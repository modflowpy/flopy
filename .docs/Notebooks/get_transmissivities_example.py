# # Computing transmissivity-weighted averages
#
# Demonstration of `flopy.utils.get_transmissivities` method
# for computing open interval transmissivities (for weighted averages of heads or fluxes)
# In practice this method might be used to:
#
# * compute vertically-averaged head target values representative of observation wells of varying open intervals (including variability in saturated thickness due to the position of the water table)
# * apportion boundary fluxes (e.g. from an analytic element model) among model layers based on transmissivity.
# * any other analysis where a distribution of transmissivity by layer is needed for a specified vertical interval of the model.

# ### Make up some open interval tops and bottoms and some heads
# * (these could be lists of observation well screen tops and bottoms)
# * the heads array contains the simulated head in each model layer,
#   at the location of each observation well (for example, what you would get back from HYDMOD if you had an entry for each layer at the location of each head target).
# * make up a model grid with uniform horizontal k of 2.

# ### Get transmissivities along the diagonal cells
# * alternatively, if a model's coordinate information has been set up, the real-world x and y coordinates could be supplied with the `x` and `y` arguments
# * if `sctop` and `scbot` arguments are given, the transmissivites are computed for the open intervals only
#   (cells that are partially within the open interval have reduced thickness, cells outside of the open interval have transmissivities of 0). If no `sctop` or `scbot` arguments are supplied, trasmissivites reflect the full saturated thickness in each column of cells (see plot below, which shows different open intervals relative to the model layering)

# ### Plot the model top and layer bottoms (colors)
# open intervals are shown as boxes
# * well 0 has zero transmissivities for each layer, as it is below the model bottom
# * well 1 has T values of 0 for layers 1 and 2, and 1 for layer 3 (K=2 x 0.5 thickness)
