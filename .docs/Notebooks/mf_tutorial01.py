# # MODFLOW Tutorial 1: Confined Steady-State Flow Model
#
# This tutorial demonstrates use of FloPy to develop a simple MODFLOW-2005
# model.

# ## Getting Started
#
# If FloPy has been properly installed, then it can be imported as follows:
from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

import numpy as np

import flopy

# Now that we can import flopy, we begin creating our simple MODFLOW model.
# numpy is imported to create arrays of model data.

# ## Creating the MODFLOW Model
#
# One of the nice things about creating models in python is that it is very
# easy to change one or two things and completely change the grid resolution
# for your model.  So in this example, we will design our python script so
# that the number of layers, columns, and rows can be easily changed.
#
# We can create a very simple MODFLOW model that has a basic package (BAS),
# discretization input file (DIS), layer-property flow (LPF) package, output
# control (OC), and preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solver.  Each one
# of these has its own input file, which will be created automatically by
# flopy, provided that we pass flopy the correct information.

# ### Discretization
#
# We start by creating a temporary workspace, then a flopy model object.

temp_dir = TemporaryDirectory()
workspace = Path(temp_dir.name)
name = "tutorial01_mf"
mf = flopy.modflow.Modflow(name, exe_name="mf2005", model_ws=workspace)

# Next, let's proceed by defining our model domain and creating a MODFLOW grid
# to span the domain.

Lx = 1000.0
Ly = 1000.0
ztop = 0.0
zbot = -50.0
nlay = 1
nrow = 10
ncol = 10
delr = Lx / ncol
delc = Ly / nrow
delv = (ztop - zbot) / nlay
botm = np.linspace(ztop, zbot, nlay + 1)

# With this information, we can now create the flopy discretization object by
# entering the following:

dis = flopy.modflow.ModflowDis(
    mf, nlay, nrow, ncol, delr=delr, delc=delc, top=ztop, botm=botm[1:]
)

# ### Basic Package
#
# Next we can create a flopy object that represents the MODFLOW Basic Package.
# For this simple model, we will assign constant head values of 10. and 0. to
# the first and last model columns (in all layers), respectively. The python
# code for doing this is:

ibound = np.ones((nlay, nrow, ncol), dtype=np.int32)
ibound[:, :, 0] = -1
ibound[:, :, -1] = -1
strt = np.ones((nlay, nrow, ncol), dtype=np.float32)
strt[:, :, 0] = 10.0
strt[:, :, -1] = 0.0
bas = flopy.modflow.ModflowBas(mf, ibound=ibound, strt=strt)

# ### Layer-Property Flow Package

# Constant values of 10. are assigned for the horizontal and vertical
# hydraulic conductivity:

lpf = flopy.modflow.ModflowLpf(mf, hk=10.0, vka=10.0, ipakcb=53)

# Because we did not specify a value for laytyp, Flopy will use the default
# value of 0, which means that this model will be confined.

# ### Output Control
#
# Here we can use the default OC settings by specifying the following:

spd = {(0, 0): ["print head", "print budget", "save head", "save budget"]}
oc = flopy.modflow.ModflowOc(mf, stress_period_data=spd, compact=True)

# The stress period dictionary is used to set what output is saved for the
# corresponding stress period and time step.  In this case, the tuple `(0, 0)`
# means that stress period 1 and time step 1 for MODFLOW will have output
# saved. Head and budgets will be printed and head and budget information
# will be saved.

# ### Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Package
#
# The default settings used by flopy will be used by specifying the following
# commands:

pcg = flopy.modflow.ModflowPcg(mf)

# ### Writing the MODFLOW Data Files
#
# The MODFLOW input data files are written by simply issuing the following:

mf.write_input()

# ## Running the Model
#
# Flopy can also be used to run the model. The model object (`mf` in this
# example) has an attached method that will run the model. For this to work,
# the MODFLOW program must be located somewhere within the system path, or
# within the working directory. In this example, we have specified that the
# name of the executable program is 'mf2005'. Issue the following to run
# the model:

success, buff = mf.run_model()
assert success, "MODFLOW did not terminate normally."

# Here we have used run_model, and we could also have specified values for the
# optional keywords silent, pause, and report.

# ## Post-Processing the Results
#
# Now that we have successfully built and run our MODFLOW model, we can look at
# the results. MODFLOW writes the simulated heads to a binary data output file.
# We cannot look at these heads with a text editor, but flopy has a binary
# utility that can be used to read the heads. The following statements will
# read the binary head file and create a plot of simulated heads for layer 1:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import flopy.utils.binaryfile as bf

# Extract the heads

hds = bf.HeadFile(Path(workspace) / f"{name}.hds")
head = hds.get_data(totim=1.0)

# Contour the heads

extent = (delr / 2.0, Lx - delr / 2.0, Ly - delc / 2.0, delc / 2.0)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, aspect="equal")
ax.contour(head[0, :, :], levels=np.arange(1, 10, 1), extent=extent)

# Flopy also has some pre-canned plotting capabilities can can be accessed
# using the `PlotMapView()` class. The following code shows how to use the
# plotmapview class to plot boundary conditions (`IBOUND`), plot the grid,
# plot head contours, and plot vectors:

# Extract the heads
hds = bf.HeadFile(Path(workspace) / f"{name}.hds")
times = hds.get_times()
head = hds.get_data(totim=times[-1])

# Extract the cell-by-cell flows

cbb = bf.CellBudgetFile(Path(workspace) / f"{name}.cbc")
kstpkper_list = cbb.get_kstpkper()
frf = cbb.get_data(text="FLOW RIGHT FACE", totim=times[-1])[0]
fff = cbb.get_data(text="FLOW FRONT FACE", totim=times[-1])[0]
qx, qy, qz = flopy.utils.postprocessing.get_specific_discharge(
    (frf, fff, None), mf, head
)

# Create the figure

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, aspect="equal")
modelmap = flopy.plot.PlotMapView(model=mf, layer=0, ax=ax)
qm = modelmap.plot_ibound()
lc = modelmap.plot_grid()
cs = modelmap.contour_array(head, levels=np.linspace(0, 10, 11))
quiver = modelmap.plot_vector(qx, qy)

# Clean up the temporary workspace

try:
    temp_dir.cleanup()
except:
    # prevent windows permission error
    pass
