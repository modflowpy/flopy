# # Working with MODFLOW-NWT v 1.1 option blocks
#
# In MODFLOW-NWT an option block is present for the WEL file, UZF file, and SFR file. This block takes keyword arguments that are supplied in an option line in other versions of MODFLOW.
#
# The `OptionBlock` class was created to provide combatibility with the MODFLOW-NWT option block and allow the user to easily edit values within the option block

# ### Let's look at the options attribute of the UZF object
