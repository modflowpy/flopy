Although this simulation is for steady flow, starting heads still need to be specified. They are used as the head for fixed-head cells (where {\\tt ibound} is negative), and as a starting point to compute the saturated thickness for cases of unconfined flow. "

The latter requires specification of the layer, row, column, and injection rate of the well for each stress period. The layers, rows, columns, and the stress period are numbered (consistent with Python's zero-based numbering convention) starting at 0. The required data are stored in a Python dictionary ({\\tt lrcQ} in the code below), which is used in FloPy to store data that can vary by stress period. The {\\tt lrcQ} dictionary specifies that two wells (one in cell 1, 1, 51 and one in cell 1, 1, 151), each with a rate of -1 m$^3$/m/d, will be active for the first stress period.
