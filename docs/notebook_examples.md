+ [Upper San Pedro Basin](../examples/groundwater_paper/Notebooks/uspb.ipynb) simulated model results (figure 2) and computed capture fraction (figure 5) Notebook.

##### ***SWI2 examples***

+ [Example 1](../examples/Notebooks/flopy3_swi2package_ex1.ipynb) of the SWI2 manual, simulating a rotating interface.

+ [Example 4](../examples/Notebooks/flopy3_swi2package_ex4.ipynb) of the SWI2 manual, upconing below a pumping well below a two-aquifer island system.

##### ***Model analysis and error checking examples***

+ An overview of the FloPy [model input data `check()` method capabilities](../examples/Notebooks/flopy3_ModelCheckerExample.ipynb).

+ An overview of the FloPy [zone budget `ZoneBudget()` method capabilities](../examples/Notebooks/flopy3_ZoneBudget_example) Notebook. The `ZoneBudget()` method is a python implementation of USGS ZONEBUDGET executable for MODFLOW (Harbaugh, 1990).

+ An overview of the FloPy [`get_transmissivities()` method for computing open interval transmissivities (for weighted averages of heads or fluxes)](../examples/Notebooks/flopy3_get_transmissivities_example.ipynb) Notebook. This method can be used to:
	* compute vertically-averaged head target values representative of observation wells of varying open intervals (including variability in saturated thickness due to the position of the water table). This may be especially important for reducing error in observations used for parameter estimation, in areas with appreciable vertical head gradients (due to aquitards, pumping, discharge to surface water, etc.)
	* apportion boundary fluxes (e.g. from an analytic element model) among model layers based on transmissivity.
	* any other analysis where a distribution of transmissivity is needed for a specified vertical interval of the model.
