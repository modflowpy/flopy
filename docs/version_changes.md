FloPy Changes
-----------------------------------------------
### Version 3.2.10
* Added parameter_load variable to `mbase` that is set to true if parameter data are applied in the model (only used in models that support parameters). If this is set to `True` `free_format_input` is set to `True` (if currently `False`) when the `write_input()` method is called. This change preserves the precision of parameter data (which is free format data).
* MODFLOW 6 model and simulation packages can not be retrieved as a `MFSimulation` attribute
* Added support for multicomponent load in `mfsft.py`
* Added functionality to read esri-style epsg codes from [spatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org).
* Added functionality to MODFLOW 6 that will automatically replace the existing package with the one being added if it has the same name as the existing package.
* Added separate MODFLOW 6 model classes for each model type. Model classes contain name file options.
* Added standard `run_model()` method arguments to mf6 `run_simulation()` method.
* some performance improvements to checking
* `SpatialReference.export_array()` now writes 3-D numpy arrays to multiband GeoTiffs
* Add load support to for MNW1; ModflowMnw1 now uses a `stress_period_data` `Mflist` to store MNW information, similar to other BC packages.
* Added a Triangle class that is a light wrapper for the Triangle program for generating triangular meshes.  Added a notebook called flopy3_triangle.ipynb that demonstrates how to use it and build a MODFLOW 6 model with a triangular mesh.  The current version of this Triangle class should be considered beta functionality as it is likely to change.

* Bug fixes:
    * Fixed issue in HOB when the same layer is specified in the `MLAY` data (dataset 4). If the layer exists the previous fraction value is added to the current value.
    * Fixed bug in segment renumbering
    * Changed default value for `ioutobs` `**kwargs` in `mtsft.py` from None to 0 to prevent failure.
    * Fixed bug when passing extra components info from load to constructor in `mtsft.py` and `mtrct.py`.
    * Fixed bug in `mt3ddsp` load - if `multidiffusion` is not found, should only read one 3d array.
    * Fixed bug in `zonbud` utility that wasn't accumulating flow from constant heads.
    * Fixed minor bug that precluded the passing of mass-balance record names (`TOTAL_IN`, `IN-OUT`, etc.).
    * Fixed bug when writing shapefile projection (`.prj`) files using relative paths.
    * Fixed bugs in `sfr.load()` -- `weight` and `flwtol` should be cast as floats, not integers.
    * Fixed bug when `SpatialReference` supplied with geographic CRS.
    * Fixed bug in `mfsfr.py` when writing kinematic data (`irtflg >0`).
    * Fixed issue from change in MODFLOW 6 `inspect.getargspec()` method (for getting method arguments).
    * Fixed MODFLOW 6 BINARY keyword for reading binary data from a file using  `OPEN/CLOSE` (needs parentheses around it).

### Version 3.2.9
* Modified MODFLOW 5 OC stress_period_data=None default behaviour. If MODFLOW 5 OC stress_period_data is not provided then binary head output is saved for the last time step of each stress period.
* added multiple component support to ``mt3dusgs SFT`` module
* Optimized loading and saving of MODFLOW 6 files
* MODFLOW 6 identifiers are now zero based
* Added remove_package method in MFSimulation and MFModel that removes MODFLOW 6 packages from the existing simulation/model
* Changed some of the input argument names for MODFLOW 6 classes.  Note that this will break some existing user scripts.  For example, the stress period information was passed to the boundary package classes using the periodrecarray argument.  The argument is now called stress_period_data in order to be consistent with other Flopy functionality.
* Flopy code for MODFLOW 6 generalized to support different model types
* Flopy code for some MODFLOW 6 arguments now have default values in order to be consistent with other Flopy functionality
* Added `ModflowSfr2.export_transient_variable` method to export shapefiles of segment data variables, with stress period data as attributes
* Added support for UZF package gages

* Bug fixes:
    * Fixed issue with default settings for MODFLOW 5 SUB package `dp` dataset.
    * Fixed issue if an external BC list file has only one entry
    * Some patching for recarray issues with latest ``numpy`` release (there are more of these lurking...)
	* Fixed setting model relative path for MODFLOW 6 simulations
	* Python 2.7 compatibility issues fixed for MODFLOW 6 simulations
	* IMS file name conflicts now automatically resolved
	* Fixed issue with passing in numpy ndarrays arrays as layered data
	* Doc string formatting for MODFLOW 6 packages fixed to make doc strings easier to read
	* UZF package: fixed issues with handling of finf, pet, extdp and extwc arrays.
	* SFR package: fixed issue with reading stress period data where not all segments are listed for periods > 0.
	* `SpatialReference.write_gridSpec` was not converting the model origin coordinates to model length units.
	* shorted integer field lengths written to shapefiles to 18 characters; some readers may misinterpret longer field lengths as float dtypes.

### Version 3.2.8
* Added `has_package(name)` method to see if a package exists. This feature goes nicely with `get_package(name)` method.
* Added `set_model_units()` method to change model units for all files created by a model. This method can be useful when creating MODFLOW-LGR models from scratch.
* Bug fixes:
    * Installation: Added dfn files required by MODFLOW 6 functionality to MANIFEST.in so that they are included in the distribution.
    * SFR2 package: Fixed issue reading transient data when `ISFOPT` is 4 or 5 for the first stress period.

### Version 3.2.7 - develop
* Added SFR2 package functionarlity
	* `export_inlets` method to write shapefile showing locations where external flows are entering the stream network.  

		
### Version 3.2.7
* Added beta support for MODFLOW 6 See [here](./mf6.md) for more information.
* Added support for retrieving time series from binary cell-by-cell files. Cell-by-cell time series are accessed in the same way they are accessed for heads and concentrations but a text string is required.
* Added support for FORTRAN free format array data using n*value where n is the number of times value is repeated.
* Added support for comma separators in 1D data in LPF and UPF files
* Added support for comma separators on non array data lines in DIS, BCF, LPF, UPW, HFB, and RCH Packages.

* Added a `.get_residual()` method to the `CellBudgetFile` class.
* Added support for binary stress period files (`OPEN/CLOSE filename (BINARY)`) in `wel` stress packages on load and instantiation. Will extend to other list-based MODFLOW stress packages.
* Added a new `flopy.utils.HeadUFile` Class (located in binaryfile.py) for reading unstructured head files from MODFLOW-USG.  The `.get_data()` method for this class returns a list of one-dimensional head arrays for each layer.
* Added metadata.acdd class to fetch model metadata from ScienceBase.gov and manage CF/ACDD-complient metadata for NetCDF export
* Added sparse export option for boundary condition stress period data, where only cells for that B.C. are exported (for example, `package.stress_period_data.export('stuff.shp', sparse=True)`)
* Added additional SFR2 package functionality: 
	*  `.export_linkages()` and `.export_outlets()` methods to export routing linkages and outlets
	*  sparse shapefile export, where only cells with SFR reaches are included

* Added `.get_layer()` method to DIS package. 
* Added `.get_saturated_thickness()` and `.get_gradients()` methods
* Bug fixes:
    * OC package: Fixed bug when printing and saving data for select stress periods and timesteps. In previous versions, OC data was repeated until respecified.
    * SUB package: Fixed bug if data set 15 is passed to preserved unit numbers (i.e., use unit numbers passed on load).
    * SUB and SUB-WT packages: Fixed bugs `.load()` to pop original unit number.
    * BTN package: Fixed bug in obs.
    * LPF package: Fixed bug regarding when HANI is read and written.
    * UZF package: added support for MODFLOW NWT options block; fixed issue with loading files with thti/thtr options
    * SFR package: fixed bug with segment renumbering, issues with reading transient text file output, 
    * Fixed issues with dynamic setting of `SpatialReference` parameters
    * NWT package: forgive missing value for MXITERXMD
    * MNW2 package: fix bug where ztop and zbotm were written incorrectly in `get_allnode_data()`. This was not affecting writing of these variables, only their values in this summary array.
    * PCGN package: fixed bug writing package.
    * Fixed issue in `Util2d` when non-integer `cnstnt` passed.

    * FHB Package - no support for flow or head auxiliary variables (datasets 2, 3, 6, and 8)
    * HOB Package
* New utilities:
	* `flopy.utils.get_transmissivities()` Computes transmissivity in each model layer at specified locations and open intervals. A saturated thickness is determined for each row, column or x, y location supplied, based on the well open interval (sctop, scbot), if supplied, otherwise the layer tops and bottoms
    and the water table are used.

* Improved support for changing the output format of arrays and variables written to MODFLOW input files. 
* Restructued SEAWAT support so that packages can be added directly to the SEAWAT model, in addition to the approach of adding a modflow model and a mt3d model.  Can now load a SEAWAT model.
* Added load support for MT3DMS Reactions package
* Added multi-species support for MT3DMS Reactions package
* Added static method to Mt3dms().load_mas that reads an MT3D mass file and returns a recarray
* Added static method to Mt3dms().load_obs that reads an MT3D mass file and returns a recarray

### Version 3.2.4
* Added basic model checking functionality (`.check()`).

* Added support for reading SWR Process observation, stage, budget, flow, reach-aquifer exchanges, and structure flows.

* `flopy.utils.HydmodObs` returns a numpy recarray. Previously numpy arrays were returned except when the `slurp()` method was used. The slurp method has been deprecated but the same functionality is available using the `get_data()` method. The recarray returned from the `get_data()` method includes the `totim` value and one or all of the observations (`HYDLBL`).

* Added support for MODFLOW-USG DISU package for unstructured grids.

* Added class (`Gridgen`) for creating layered quadtree grids using GRIDGEN (`flopy.utils.gridgen`). See the flopy3_gridgen notebook for an example of how to use the `Gridgen` class.

* Added user-specified control on use of `OPEN/CLOSE` array options (see flopy3_external_file_handling notebook).

* Added support for the SEAWAT viscosity (VSC) package.

* Added support for the MODFLOW Stream (STR), Streamflow-Routing (SFR2), Subsidence (SUB), and Subsidence and Aquifer-System Compaction Package for Water-Table Aquifers (SWT) Packages.

* Mt3d model was redesigned based on recent changes to the Modflow model.  Mt3d packages rewritten to support multi-species.  Primary packages can be loaded (btn, adv, dsp, ssm, gcg).  Array utilities modified to read some MT3D RARRAY formats.

* Fixed array loading functionality for case when the CNSTNT value is zero.  If CNSTNT is zero and is used as an array multiplier, it is changed to 1 (as done in MODFLOW).

* Added support for the MODFLOW HYDMOD (HYD) Package and reading binary files created by the HYDMOD Package (`HydmodObs` Class) in the `flopy.utils` submodule.

* `flopy.utils.CellBudgetFile` returns a numpy recarray for list based budget data. Previously a dictionary with the `node` number and `q` were returned. The recarray will return the `node` number, `q`, and the `aux` variables for list based budget data.

* Added travis-ci automated testing.

### Version 3.2.2
* FloPy now supports some simple plotting capabilities for two- and three-dimensional model input data array classes  and transient two-dimensional stress period input data using the `.plot()` methods associated with the data array classes (`util_2d`, `util_3d`, and `transient_2d`). The model results reader classes (`HeadFile`, `UcnFile`, and `CellBudgetFile`) have also been extended to include a `.plot()` method that can be used to create simple plots of model output data. See the notebook [flopy3_PlotArrayExample](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_PlotArrayExample.ipynb).

* Added `.to_shapefile()` method to two- and three-dimensional model input data array classes (`util_2d` and `util_3d`), transient two-dimensional stress period input data classes (`transient_2d`), and model output data classes (`HeadFile`, `UcnFile`, and `CellBudgetFile`) that allows model data to be exported as polygon shapefiles with separate attribute columns for each model layer.

* Added support for ASCII model results files.

* Added support for reading MODPATH version 6 pathline and endpoint output files and plotting MODPATH results using mapping capabilities in `flopy.plot` submodule.

* Added `load()` method for MODFLOW GMG solver.

* Bug fixes:
  * Multiplier in array control record was not being applied to arrays
  * vani parameter was not supported

### Version 3.2.1
* FloPy can now be used with **Python 3.x**

* Revised setters for package class variables stored using the `util_2d` or `util_3d` classes.

* Added option to load a subset of MODFLOW packages in a MODFLOW model name file using `load_only=` keyword.

### Version 3.1
* FloPy now supports some simple mapping and cross-section capabilities through the `flopy.plot` submodule. See the notebook [flopy3_MapExample](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_MapExample.ipynb).

* Full support for all Output Control (OC) options including DDREFERENCE, SAVE IBOUND, and layer lists. All Output Control Input is specified using words. Output Control Input using numeric codes is still available in the ModflowOc88 class. The ModflowOc88 class is currently deprecated and no longer actively maintained.

* Added support for standard MULT package FUNCTION and EXPRESSION functionality are supported. MODFLOW parameters are not supported in `write()` methods. 

### Version 3.0

FloPy is significantly different from earlier versions of FloPy (previously hosted on [googlecode](https://code.google.com/p/flopy/)). The main changes are:

* FloPy is fully zero-based. This means that layers, rows and columns start counting at *zero*. The reason for this is consistency. Arrays are zero-based by default in Python, so it was confusing to have a mix.

* Input for packages that take *layer, row, column, data* input (like the wel or ghb package) has changed and is much more flexible now. See the notebook [flopy3boundaries](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3boundaries.ipynb)

* Input for the MT3DMS Source/Sink Mixing (SSM) Package has been modified to be consistent with the new MODFLOW boundary package input and is more flexible than previous versions of FloPy. See the notebook [flopy3ssm](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_multi-component_SSM.ipynb)

* Support for use of EXTERNAL and OPEN/CLOSE array specifiers has been improved.

* *load()* methods have been developed for all of the standard MODFLOW packages and a few less used packages (*e.g.* SWI2).

* MODFLOW parameter support has been added to the `load()` methods. MULT, PVAL, and ZONE packages are now supported and parameter data are converted to arrays in the `load()` methods. MODFLOW parameters are not supported in `write()` methods.
