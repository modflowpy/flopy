### Version 3.3.0

* Dropped support for python 2.7
* Switched from [pangeo binder](https://aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.io/) binder to [mybinder.org binder](https://mybinder.org)
* Added support for MODFLOW 6 Skeletal Compaction and Subsidence (CSUB) package

* Bug fixes:

    * Fix issue in MNW2 when the input file had spaced between lines in Dataset 2. [#736](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/pull/736)
    * Fix issue in MNW2 when the input file uses wellids with inconsistent cases in Dataset 2 and 4. Internally the MNW2 will convert all wellids to lower case strings. [#736](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/pull/736)
    * Fix issue with VertexGrid plotting errors, squeeze proper dimension for head output, in `PlotMapView` and `PlotCrossSection`
    * Fix issue in `PlotUtilities._plot_array_helper` mask MODFLOW-6 no flow and dry cells before plotting
    * Removed assumption that transient SSM data appears in the first stress period [#754](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/issues/754) [#756](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/issues/754).  Fix includes a new autotest ([t068_test_ssm.py](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/develop/autotest/t068_test_ssm.py)) that adds transient concentration data after the first stress period.
    * Fix issues with add_record method for MfList [#758](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/pull/758)

### Version 3.2.13

* ModflowFlwob: Variable `irefsp` is now a zero-based integer (#596)
* ModflowFlwob: Added a load method and increased precision of `toffset` when writing to file (#598)
* New feature GridIntersect (#610): The GridIntersect object allows the user to intersect shapes (Points, LineStrings and Polygons) with a MODFLOW grid. These intersections return a numpy.recarray containing the intersection information, i.e. cell IDs, lengths or areas, and a shapely representation of the intersection results. Grids can be structured or vertex grids. Two intersections methods are implemented: `"structured"` and `"strtree"`: the former accelerates intersections with structured grids. The latter is more flexible and also works for vertex grids. The GridIntersect class is available through `flopy.utils.gridintersect`. The functionality requires the Shapely module. See the [example notebook](../examples/Notebooks/flopy3_grid_intersection_demo.ipynb) for an overview of this new feature.
* New feature `Raster` (#634): The Raster object allows the user to load raster files (Geotiff, arc ascii, .img) and sample points, sample polygons, create cross sections, crop, and resample raster data to a Grid.  Cropping has been implemented using a modified version of the ray casting algorithm for speed purposes. Resampling a raster can be performed with structured, vertex, and unstructured Grids. Rasters will return a numpy array of resampled data in the same shape as the Grid. The Raster class is available by calling `flopy.utils.Raster`. The functionality requires rasterio, affine, and scipy. See the ([example notebook](../examples/Notebooks/flopy3_raster_intersection.ipynb)) for an overview of this feature.
* Modify NAM and MFList output files to remove excessive whitespace (#622, #722)
* Deprecate `crs` class from `flopy.utils.reference` in favor of `CRS` class from `flopy.export.shapefile_utils` (#608)
* New feature in `PlotCrossSection` (#660). Added a `geographic_coords` parameter flag to `PlotCrossSection` which allows the user to plot cross sections with geographic coordinates on the x-axis. The default behavior is to plot distance along cross sectional line on the x-axis. See the ([example notebook](../examples/Notebooks/flopy3_PlotCrossSection_demo.ipynb)) for an overview of this feature.
* New feature with binaryfile readers, including `HeadFile` and `CellBudgetFile` (#669): [`with` statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) is supported to open files for reading in a context manager, which automatically close when done or if an exception is raised.
* Improved the flopy list reader for MODFLOW stress packages (for mf2005, mfnwt, etc.), which may use SFAC to scale certain columns depending on the package.  The list reading now supports reading from external files, in addition to open/close.  The (binary) option is also supported for both open/close and external.  This new list reader is used for reading standard stress package lists and also lists used to create parameters.  The new list reader should be consistent with MODFLOW behavior.
* SfrFile detects additional columns (#708)
* Add a `default_float_format` property to mfsfr2, which is string formatted by NumPy versions > 1.14.0, or `{:.8g}` for older NumPy versions (#710)
* Support for pyshp 1.2.1 dropped, pyshp 2.1.0 support maintained
* Improved VTK export capabilities.  Added export for VTK at array level, package level, and model level.  Added binary head file export and cell by cell file export.  Added the ability to export point scalars in addition to cell scalars, and added smooth surface generation.  VTK export now supports writing transient data as well as exporting to binary .vtu files.
* Support for copying model and package instances with `copy.deepcopy()`
* Added link to Binder on [README](README.md) and [notebooks_examples](../examples/docs/notebook_examples.md) markdown documents. Binder provides an environment that runs and interactively serves the FloPy Jupyter notebooks.

* Bug fixes:

    * When using the default `iuzfbnd=None` in the `__init__` routine of mtuzt.py, instantiation of IUZBND was generating a 3D array instead of a 2D array.  Now generates a 2D array
    * ModflowSfr2 `__init__` was being slowed considerably by the `ModflowSfr2.all_segments` property method. Modified the `ModflowSfr2.graph` property method that describes routing connections between segments to handle cases where segments aren't listed in stress period 0.
    * Ensure disordered fields in `reach_data` (Dataset 2) can be supported in `ModflowSfr2` and written to MODFLOW SFR input files.
    * When loading a MF model with UZF active, item 8 ("`[IUZROW]` `[IUZCOL]` `IFTUNIT` `[IUZOPT]`") wasn't processed correctly when a user comment appeared at the end of the line
    * MODFLOW-6 DISU JA arrays are now treated as zero-based cell IDs. JA, IHC, CL12 are outputted as jagged arrays.
    * Models with multiple MODFLOW-6 WEL packages now load and save correctly.
    * Exporting individual array and list data to a shapefile was producing an invalid attribute error. Attribute reference has been fixed.
    * Fix UnboundLocalError and typo with `flopy.export.shapefile_utils.CRS` class (#608)
    * Fix Python 2.7 issue with `flopy.export.utils.export_contourf` (#625)
    * When loading a MT3D-USGS model, keyword options (if used) were ignored (#649)
    * When loading a modflow model, spatial reference information was not being passed to the SpatialReference class (#659)
    * Fix specifysurfk option in UZF, ModflowUZF1 read and write surfk variable

    * Fixed the export_array_contours function as contours would not export in some cases (#577).  Added tests of export_array_contours and export_array to t007_test.py as these methods were not tested at all.

### Version 3.2.11
* Added support for the drain return package.
* Added support for pyshp version 2.x, which contains a different call signature for the writer than earlier versions.
* Added a new flopy3_MT3DMS_examples notebook, which uses Flopy to reproduce the example problems described in the MT3DMS documentation report by Zheng and Wang (1999).
* Pylint is now used on Travis for the Python 3.5 distribution to check for coding errors.
* Added testing with Python 3.7 on Travis, dropped testing Python 3.4.
* Added a new htop argument to the vtk writer, which allows cell tops to be defined by the simulated head.
* Generalized exporting and plotting to also work with MODFLOW 6. Added a new grid class and deprecated SpatialReference class. Added new plotting interfaces, `PlotMapView` and `PlotCrossSection`. Began deprecation of `ModelMap` and `ModelCrossSection` classes.
* Spatial reference system cache moved to epsgref.json in the user's data directory.
* Attempts to read empty files from flopy.utils raise a IOError exception.
* Changed interface for creating and accessing MODFLOW 6 observation, time series, and time array series packages. These packages can now be created and accessed directly from the package that references them.  These changes are not backward compatible, and will require existing scripts to be modified.  See the flopy3_mf6_obs_ts_tas.ipynb notebook for instructions.
* Changed the MODFLOW 6 fname argument to be filename.  This change is not backward compatible, and will require existing scripts to be modified if the fname argument was used in the package constructor.
* Added modflow-nwt options support for `ModflowWel`, `ModflowSfr2`, and `ModflowUzf1` via the `OptionBlock` class.

* Bug fixes:
    * Removed variable MXUZCON from `mtuzt.py` that was present during the development of MT3D-USGS, but was not included in the release version of MT3D-USGS.
    * Now account for UZT -> UZT2 changes with the release of MT3D-USGS 1.0.1.  Use of UZT is no longer supported.
    * Fixed bug in `mfuzf1.py` when reading and writing `surfk` when `specifysurfk = True`.
    * Fixed bug in `ModflowStr.load()`, utility would fail to load when comments were present.

    * Ensure that external 1-D free arrays are written on one line.
    * Typos corrected for various functions, keyword arguments, property names, input file options, and documentation.
    * Fixed bug in `Mt3dUzt.__init__` that originated when copying code from mtsft.py to get started on mtuzt.py class.  The variable ioutobs doesn't exist in the UZT package and should never have appeared in the package to begin with.

### Version 3.2.10
* Added parameter_load variable to `mbase` that is set to true if parameter data are applied in the model (only used in models that support parameters). If this is set to `True` `free_format_input` is set to `True` (if currently `False`) when the `write_input()` method is called. This change preserves the precision of parameter data (which is free format data).
* MODFLOW 6 model and simulation packages can not be retrieved as a `MFSimulation` attribute
* Added support for multicomponent load in `mfsft.py`
* Added functionality to read esri-style epsg codes from [spatialreference.org](https://spatialreference.org).
* Added functionality to MODFLOW 6 that will automatically replace the existing package with the one being added if it has the same name as the existing package.
* Added separate MODFLOW 6 model classes for each model type. Model classes contain name file options.
* Added standard `run_model()` method arguments to mf6 `run_simulation()` method.
* some performance improvements to checking
* `SpatialReference.export_array()` now writes 3-D numpy arrays to multiband GeoTiffs
* Add load support to for MNW1; ModflowMnw1 now uses a `stress_period_data` `Mflist` to store MNW information, similar to other BC packages.
* Added a Triangle class that is a light wrapper for the Triangle program for generating triangular meshes.  Added a notebook called flopy3_triangle.ipynb that demonstrates how to use it and build a MODFLOW 6 model with a triangular mesh.  The current version of this Triangle class should be considered beta functionality as it is likely to change.
* Added support for MODPATH 7 (beta).
* Added support for MODPATH 3 and 5 pathline and endpoint output files.
* Added support for MODPATH timeseries output files (`flopy.utils.TimeseriesFile()`).
* Added support for plotting MODPATH timeseries output data (`plot_timeseries()`) with ModelMap.

* Bug fixes:
    * Fixed issue in HOB when the same layer is specified in the `MLAY` data (dataset 4). If the layer exists the previous fraction value is added to the current value.
    * Fixed bug in segment renumbering
    * Changed default value for `ioutobs` `**kwargs` in `mtsft.py` from None to 0 to prevent failure.
    * Fixed bug when passing extra components info from load to constructor in `mtsft.py` and `mtrct.py`.
    * Fixed bug in `mt3ddsp` load - if `multidiffusion` is not found, should only read one 3d array.
    * Fixed bug in `zonbud` utility that wasn't accumulating flow from constant heads.
    * Fixed minor bug that precluded the passing of mass-balance record names (`TOTAL_IN`, `IN-OUT`, etc.).
    * Fixed bug when writing shapefile projection (`.prj`) files using relative paths.
    * Fixed bugs in `sfr.load()` -- `weight` and `flwtol` should be cast as floats, not integers.
    * Fixed bug when `SpatialReference` supplied with geographic CRS.

    * Fixed issue from change in MODFLOW 6 `inspect.getargspec()` method (for getting method arguments).
    * Fixed MODFLOW 6 BINARY keyword for reading binary data from a file using  `OPEN/CLOSE` (needs parentheses around it).
    * Fixed bug in `mtlkt.py` when initiating, loading, and/or writing lkt input file related to multi-species problems.


### Version 3.2.9
* Modified MODFLOW 5 OC stress_period_data=None default behaviour. If MODFLOW 5 OC stress_period_data is not provided then binary head output is saved for the last time step of each stress period.
* added multiple component support to ``mt3dusgs SFT`` module
* Optimized loading and saving of MODFLOW 6 files
* MODFLOW 6 identifiers are now zero based
* Added remove_package method in MFSimulation and MFModel that removes MODFLOW 6 packages from the existing simulation/model
* Changed some of the input argument names for MODFLOW 6 classes.  Note that this will break some existing user scripts.  For example, the stress period information was passed to the boundary package classes using the periodrecarray argument.  The argument is now called stress_period_data in order to be consistent with other Flopy functionality.
* Flopy code for MODFLOW 6 generalized to support different model types
* Flopy code for some MODFLOW 6 arguments now have default values in order to be consistent with other Flopy functionality
* Added `ModflowSfr2.export_transient_variable` method to export shapefiles of segment data variables, with stress period data as attributes

	* `SpatialReference.write_gridSpec` was not converting the model origin coordinates to model length units.
	* shorted integer field lengths written to shapefiles to 18 characters; some readers may misinterpret longer field lengths as float dtypes.


### Version 3.2.8
* Added `has_package(name)` method to see if a package exists. This feature goes nicely with `get_package(name)` method.
* Added `set_model_units()` method to change model units for all files created by a model. This method can be useful when creating MODFLOW-LGR models from scratch.
* Added SFR2 package functionality
	* `export_inlets` method to write shapefile showing locations where external flows are entering the stream network.
* Bug fixes:
    * Installation: Added dfn files required by MODFLOW 6 functionality to MANIFEST.in so that they are included in the distribution.
    * SFR2 package: Fixed issue reading transient data when `ISFOPT` is 4 or 5 for the first stress period.


### Version 3.2.7
* Added beta support for MODFLOW 6 See [here](./mf6.md) for more information.
* Added support for retrieving time series from binary cell-by-cell files. Cell-by-cell time series are accessed in the same way they are accessed for heads and concentrations but a text string is required.

* Added a new `flopy.utils.HeadUFile` Class (located in binaryfile.py) for reading unstructured head files from MODFLOW-USG.  The `.get_data()` method for this class returns a list of one-dimensional head arrays for each layer.
* Added metadata.acdd class to fetch model metadata from ScienceBase.gov and manage CF/ACDD-complaint metadata for NetCDF export
* Added sparse export option for boundary condition stress period data, where only cells for that B.C. are exported (for example, `package.stress_period_data.export('stuff.shp', sparse=True)`)
* Added additional SFR2 package functionality:
	*  `.export_linkages()` and `.export_outlets()` methods to export routing linkages and outlets

    * SUB and SUB-WT packages: Fixed bugs `.load()` to pop original unit number.
    * BTN package: Fixed bug in obs.
    * LPF package: Fixed bug regarding when HANI is read and written.

    * Fixed issues with dynamic setting of `SpatialReference` parameters
    * NWT package: forgive missing value for MXITERXMD
    * MNW2 package: fix bug where ztop and zbotm were written incorrectly in `get_allnode_data()`. This was not affecting writing of these variables, only their values in this summary array.

### Version 3.2.4
* Added basic model checking functionality (`.check()`).

* Added support for reading SWR Process observation, stage, budget, flow, reach-aquifer exchanges, and structure flows.

* `flopy.utils.HydmodObs` returns a numpy recarray. Previously numpy arrays were returned except when the `slurp()` method was used.

* Mt3d model was redesigned based on recent changes to the Modflow model.  Mt3d packages rewritten to support multi-species.  Primary packages can be loaded (btn, adv, dsp, ssm, gcg).  Array utilities modified to read some MT3D RARRAY formats.

* Fixed array loading functionality for case when the CNSTNT value is zero.  If CNSTNT is zero and is used as an array multiplier, it is changed to 1 (as done in MODFLOW).

* Added support for the MODFLOW HYDMOD (HYD) Package and reading binary files created by the HYDMOD Package (`HydmodObs` Class) in the `flopy.utils` submodule.

* `flopy.utils.CellBudgetFile` returns a numpy recarray for list based budget data. Previously a dictionary with the `node` number and `q` were returned. The recarray will return the `node` number, `q`, and the `aux` variables for list based budget data.

* Added travis-ci automated testing.

### Version 3.2.2
* FloPy now supports some simple plotting capabilities for two- and three-dimensional model input data array classes  and transient two-dimensional stress period input data using the `.plot()` methods associated with the data array classes (`util_2d`, `util_3d`, and `transient_2d`). The model results reader classes (`HeadFile`, `UcnFile`, and `CellBudgetFile`) have also been extended to include a `.plot()` method that can be used to create simple plots of model output data. See the notebook [flopy3_PlotArrayExample](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_PlotArrayExample.ipynb).

* Added `.to_shapefile()` method to two- and three-dimensional model input data array classes (`util_2d` and `util_3d`), transient two-dimensional stress period input data classes (`transient_2d`), and model output data classes (`HeadFile`, `UcnFile`, and `CellBudgetFile`) that allows model data to be exported as polygon shapefiles with separate attribute columns for each model layer.

* Added support for ASCII model results files.

* Added support for reading MODPATH version 6 pathline and endpoint output files and plotting MODPATH results using mapping capabilities in `flopy.plot` submodule.

* Added option to load a subset of MODFLOW packages in a MODFLOW model name file using `load_only=` keyword.

### Version 3.1
* FloPy now supports some simple mapping and cross-section capabilities through the `flopy.plot` submodule. See the notebook [flopy3_MapExample](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_MapExample.ipynb).

* Full support for all Output Control (OC) options including DDREFERENCE, SAVE IBOUND, and layer lists. All Output Control Input is specified using words. Output Control Input using numeric codes is still available in the ModflowOc88 class. The ModflowOc88 class is currently deprecated and no longer actively maintained.

* Added support for standard MULT package FUNCTION and EXPRESSION functionality are supported. MODFLOW parameters are not supported in `write()` methods.

### Version 3.0

FloPy is significantly different from earlier versions of FloPy (previously hosted on [googlecode](https://code.google.com/p/flopy/)). The main changes are:

* FloPy is fully zero-based. This means that layers, rows and columns start counting at *zero*. The reason for this is consistency. Arrays are zero-based by default in Python, so it was confusing to have a mix.

* Input for packages that take *layer, row, column, data* input (like the wel or ghb package) has changed and is much more flexible now. See the notebook [flopy3boundaries](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3boundaries.ipynb)

* Input for the MT3DMS Source/Sink Mixing (SSM) Package has been modified to be consistent with the new MODFLOW boundary package input and is more flexible than previous versions of FloPy. See the notebook [flopy3ssm](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_multi-component_SSM.ipynb)

* Support for use of EXTERNAL and OPEN/CLOSE array specifiers has been improved.

* *load()* methods have been developed for all of the standard MODFLOW packages and a few less used packages (*e.g.* SWI2).

* MODFLOW parameter support has been added to the `load()` methods. MULT, PVAL, and ZONE packages are now supported and parameter data are converted to arrays in the `load()` methods. MODFLOW parameters are not supported in `write()` methods.
