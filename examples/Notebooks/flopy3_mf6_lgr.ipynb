    "# FloPy\n",
    "\n",
    "FloPy has a utility for creating and managing a parent grid and a child grid.  Both grids must regular MODFLOW grids consisting of layers, rows, and columns.  The term Local Grid Refinement (LGR) is used to denote this configuration.  With the current version, only one child grid is supported; however, the utility could be used multiple times to create multiple child models.  Those child models could also be used with the utility to create grandchildren models, though it is unclear if there would be benefit to constructing models with this configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FloPy LGR utility is designed to work primarily with MODFLOW 6 as MODFLOW 6 can be used to run multiple groundwater models in the same simulation.  These models can be tightly coupled at their interfaces.  This LGR approach is based on the idea of creating multiple model instances, each with their own input and output.  This approach is different from using an unstructured grid to represent a single mesh with local refinements in areas of interest."
