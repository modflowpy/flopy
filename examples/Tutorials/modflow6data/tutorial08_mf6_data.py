# # MODFLOW 6: Data Storage Information and Performance Optimization
#
# This tutorial shows the different options for storing MODFLOW data in FloPy.
# Interaction with a FloPy MODFLOW 6 model is different from other models,
# such as MODFLOW-2005, MT3D, and SEAWAT, for example.
#
# FloPy stores model data in data objects (`MFDataArray`, `MFDataList`,
# `MFDataScalar` objects) that are accessible from packages.  Data can be
# added to a package by using the appropriate parameters when the package is
# constructed and through package attributes.
#
# The MODFLOW 6 simulation structure is arranged in the following
# generalized way:
#
# >       Simulation --> Package --> DATA
# >
# >       Simulation --> Model --> Package (--> Package) --> DATA
#
#
# This tutorial focuses on the different storage options for MODFLOW data and
# how to optimize data storage read/write speed.

# ## Introduction to Data Storage Information
# MODFLOW array and list data can either be stored internally or externally in
# text or binary files. Additionally array data can have a factor applied to
# them and can have a format flag/code to define how these data will be
# formatted. This data storage information is specified within a python
# dictionary.  The python dictionary must contain a "data" key where the data
# is stored and supports several other keys that determine how and where the
# data is stored.
#
# The following code sets up a basic simulation with a groundwater flow model.
# for the example below.

# package import
import os
from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

import numpy as np

import flopy

# set up where simulation workspace will be stored
temp_dir = TemporaryDirectory()
workspace = temp_dir.name
name = "tutorial08_mf6_data"

# create the FloPy simulation and tdis objects
sim = flopy.mf6.MFSimulation(
    sim_name=name, exe_name="mf6", version="mf6", sim_ws=workspace
)
tdis = flopy.mf6.modflow.mftdis.ModflowTdis(
    sim,
    pname="tdis",
    time_units="DAYS",
    nper=2,
    perioddata=[(1.0, 1, 1.0), (1.0, 1, 1.0)],
)
# create the Flopy groundwater flow (gwf) model object
model_nam_file = f"{name}.nam"
gwf = flopy.mf6.ModflowGwf(sim, modelname=name, model_nam_file=model_nam_file)
# create the flopy iterative model solver (ims) package object
ims = flopy.mf6.modflow.mfims.ModflowIms(sim, pname="ims", complexity="SIMPLE")
# create the discretization package
bot = np.linspace(-50.0 / 3.0, -3.0, 3)
delrow = delcol = 4.0
dis = flopy.mf6.modflow.mfgwfdis.ModflowGwfdis(
    gwf,
    pname="dis",
    nogrb=True,
    nlay=3,
    nrow=10,
    ncol=10,
    delr=delrow,
    delc=delcol,
    top=0.0,
    botm=bot,
)

# ## Setting up a Data Storage Information Dictionary
#
# To store data externally add a `filename` key to the dictionary whose
# value is the file where you want to store the data. Add a `binary` key with
# value True to make the file a binary file. Add a `prn` key whose value is
# a format code to set the format code for the data. For array data add a
# `factor` key whose value is a positive floating point number to add a
# factor/multiplier for the array.

# Below a dictionary is created that defines how a `k33` array will be stored.
# The dictionary specifies that the `k33` array be stored in the binary file
# k33.txt with a factor of 1.0 applied to the array and a print code of 1.
# The `k33` array data is constructed as a numpy array.

k33_values = np.full((3, 10, 10), 1.1)
k33 = {
    "filename": "k33.txt",
    "factor": 1.0,
    "data": k33_values,
    "iprn": 1,
    "binary": "True",
}

# The `NPF` package is then created with the `k33` array in an external binary
# file.  This binary file is created when the simulation method
# `write_simulation` is called.

npf = flopy.mf6.ModflowGwfnpf(
    gwf,
    pname="npf",
    save_flows=True,
    icelltype=[1, 1, 1],
    k=10.0,
    k22=5.0,
    k33=k33,
    xt3doptions="xt3d rhs",
    rewet_record="REWET WETFCT 1.0 IWETIT 1 IHDWET 0",
)

# External files can be set for specific layers of data.  If we want to store
# the bottom elevations for the third model layer to an external file, then
# the dictionary that we pass in for the third layer can be given a
# "filename" key.

a0 = {"factor": 0.5, "iprn": 1, "data": np.ones((10, 10))}
a1 = -100
a2 = {
    "filename": "dis.botm.3.txt",
    "factor": 2.0,
    "iprn": 1,
    "data": -100 * np.ones((10, 10)),
}

# A list containing data for the three specified layers is then passed in to
# the `botm` object's `set_record` method.

dis.botm.set_record([a0, a1, a2])
print(dis.botm.get_file_entry())

# The botm data and its attributes (filename, binary, factor, iprn) can be
# retrieved as a dictionary of dictionaries using get_record.

botm_record = dis.botm.get_record()
print("botm layer 1 record:")
print(botm_record[0])
print("\nbotm layer 2 record:")
print(botm_record[1])
print("\nbotm layer 3 record:")
print(botm_record[2])

# The botm record retrieved can be modified and then saved with set_record.
# For example, the array data's "factor" can be modified and saved.

botm_record[0]["factor"] = 0.6
dis.botm.set_record(botm_record)

# The updated value can then be retrieved.

botm_record = dis.botm.get_record()
print(f"botm layer 1 factor:  {botm_record[0]['factor']}")

# The get_record and set_record methods can also be used with list data to get
# and set the data and its "filename" and "binary" attributes. This is
# demonstrated with the wel package.  First, a wel package is constructed.

welspdict = {
    0: {"filename": "well_sp1.txt", "data": [[(0, 0, 0), 0.25]]},
    1: [[(0, 0, 0), 0.1]],
}
wel = flopy.mf6.ModflowGwfwel(
    gwf,
    print_input=True,
    print_flows=True,
    stress_period_data=welspdict,
    save_flows=False,
)

# The wel stress period data and associated "filename" and "binary" attributes
# can be retrieved with get_record.

spd_record = wel.stress_period_data.get_record()
print("Stress period 1 record:")
print(spd_record[0])
print("\nStress period 2 record:")
print(spd_record[1])

# The wel data and associated attributes can be changed by modifying the
# record and then saving it with the set_record method.

spd_record[0]["filename"] = "well_package_sp1.txt"
spd_record[0]["binary"] = True
spd_record[1]["filename"] = "well_package_sp2.bin"
wel.stress_period_data.set_record(spd_record)

# The changes can be verified by calling get_record again.

spd_record = wel.stress_period_data.get_record()
print(f"New filename for stress period 1:  {spd_record[0]['filename']}")
print(f"New binary flag for stress period 1:  {spd_record[0]['binary']}")
print(f"New filename for stress period 2:  {spd_record[1]['filename']}")

# ## Optimizing FloPy Performance
#
# By default FloPy will perform a number of verification checks on your data
# when FloPy loads or saves that data.  For large datasets turning these
# verification checks off can significantly improve FloPy's performance.
# Additionally, storing files externally can help minimize the amount of data
# FloPy reads/writes when loading and saving a simulation.  The following
# steps will help you optimize FloPy's performance for large datasets.
#
# 1) Turn off FloPy verification checks and FloPy's option to automatically
# update "maxbound".  This can be turned off on an existing
# simulation by either individually turning off each of these settings.

sim.simulation_data.auto_set_sizes = False
sim.simulation_data.verify_data = False
sim.write_simulation()

# or by setting lazy_io to True.

sim.simulation_data.lazy_io = True
sim.write_simulation()

# These options can also be turned off when loading an existing simulation
# or creating a new simulation by setting lazy_io to True.

sim2 = flopy.mf6.MFSimulation.load(
    sim_ws=workspace,
    lazy_io=True,
)

sim3 = flopy.mf6.MFSimulation(lazy_io=True)

# 2) Whenever possible save large datasets to external binary files.  Binary
# files are more compact and the data will be read and written significantly
# faster.  See MODFLOW-6 documentation for which packages and data support
# binary files.

# store all well period data in external binary files
spd_record[0]["binary"] = True
spd_record[1]["binary"] = True
wel.stress_period_data.set_record(spd_record)

# 3) For datasets that do not support binary files, save them to
# external text files.  When loading a simulation, FloPy will always parse
# MODFLOW-6 package files, but will not parse external text files when
# auto_set_sizes and verify data are both set to False.  Additionally, if
# write_simulation is later called, external files will not be re-written
# unless either the data or the file path has changed.

# store lak period data in external text files
period = {
    0: {"filename": "lak_sp1.txt", "data": [(0, "STAGE", 10.0)]},
    1: {"filename": "lak_sp2.txt", "data": [(0, "STAGE", 15.0)]},
}
lakpd = [(0, -2.0, 1)]
lakecn = [(0, 0, (0, 1, 0), "HORIZONTAL", 1.0, -5.0, 0.0, 10.0, 10.0)]
