In Directory 1- Saturated: Runs for saturated column 15 cm high. Made saturated by having bottom constant head boundary = 100 cm

Tracer --> Conservative tracer, C=1 at inlet.

Kd --> C=1 at inlet, with adsorption (kd = 0.08). No need for A-W adsorption yet since there is none at full saturation.

In Directory 2-S_of_0p68: Runs for saturation of 0.68. 

C1 --> when C=1, Kaw = 0.0021 


Cp1 --> when C=0.1, Kaw = 0.0027 


Cp01 --> when C=0.01, Kaw = 0.0040
