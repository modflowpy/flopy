 ZONEBUDGET version 3.01                 
 Program to compute a flow budget for subregions of a model using
 budget data from MODFLOW, the USGS Modular Ground-Water Flow Model.
 
  The cell-by-cell budget file is:
 freyberg.cbc                                                                    
  Single precision budget file
          3 layers        40 rows        20 columns
 
 Freyberg                                                                        
 
  The zone file is:
 zonef_mlt.zbr                                                                   
 
 Zone Array for layer   1 will be read from the Zone File
 Zone Array for layer   1 will be read using format: (20I2)
