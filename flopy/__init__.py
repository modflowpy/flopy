"""
The FloPy package consists of a set of Python scripts to run MODFLOW, MT3D,
SEAWAT and other MODFLOW-related groundwater programs. FloPy enables you to
run all these programs with Python scripts. The FloPy project started in 2009
and has grown to a fairly complete set of scripts with a growing user base.

This version of Flopy (FloPy3) was released in December 2015 with a few great
enhancements that make FloPy3 backwards incompatible. The first significant
change is that FloPy3 uses zero-based indexing everywhere, which means that
all layers, rows, columns, and stress periods start numbering at zero. This
change was made for consistency as all array-indexing was already zero-based
(as are all arrays in Python). This may take a little getting-used-to, but
hopefully will avoid confusion in the future. A second significant enhancement
concerns the ability to specify time-varying boundary conditions that are
specified with a sequence of layer-row-column-values, like the WEL and GHB
packages. A variety of flexible and readable ways have been implemented to
specify these boundary conditions. FloPy is an open-source project and any
assistance is welcomed. Please email the development team if you want to
contribute.
