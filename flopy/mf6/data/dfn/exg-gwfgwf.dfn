name auxiliary
type string

optional true
longname keyword to specify aux variables
description an array of auxiliary variable names.  There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided. Most auxiliary variables will not be used by the GWF-GWF Exchange, but they will be available for use by other parts of the program.  If an auxiliary variable with the name ``ANGLDEGX'' is found, then this information will be used as the angle (provided in degrees) between the connection face normal and the x axis, where a value of zero indicates that a normal vector points directly along the positive x axis.  The connection face normal is a normal vector on the cell face shared between the cell in model 1 and the cell in model 2 pointing away from the model 1 cell.  Additional information on ``ANGLDEGX'' is provided in the description of the DISU Package.  If an auxiliary variable with the name ``CDIST'' is found, then this information will be used as the straight-line connection distance, including the vertical component, between the two cell centers.  Both ANGLDEGX and CDIST are required if specific discharge is calculated for either of the groundwater models.

longname conductance weighting option
description is a keyword and text keyword to indicate the method that will be used for calculating the conductance for horizontal cell connections.  The text value for CELL\_AVERAGING can be ``HARMONIC'', ``LOGARITHMIC'', or ``AMT-LMK'', which means ``arithmetic-mean thickness and logarithmic-mean hydraulic conductivity''. If the user does not specify a value for CELL\_AVERAGING, then the harmonic-mean method will be used.

longname keyword to activate VARIABLECV option
description keyword to indicate that the vertical conductance will be calculated using the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell and the thickness and properties of the underlying cell.  If the DEWATERED keyword is also specified, then the vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying cell is below its top.  If these keywords are not specified, then the default condition is to calculate the vertical conductance at the start of the simulation using the initial head and the cell properties.  The vertical conductance remains constant for the entire simulation.

description is the file name for ghost node correction input file.  Information for the ghost nodes are provided in the file provided with these keywords.  The format for specifying the ghost nodes is the same as described for the GNC Package of the GWF Model.  This includes specifying OPTIONS, DIMENSIONS, and GNCDATA blocks.  The order of the ghost nodes must follow the same order as the order of the cells in the EXCHANGEDATA block.  For the GNCDATA, noden and all of the nodej values are assumed to be located in model 1, and nodem is assumed to be in model 2.

description is the file name of the water mover input file to apply to this exchange.  Information for the water mover are provided in the file provided with these keywords.  The format for specifying the water mover information is the same as described for the Water Mover (MVR) Package of the GWF Model, with two exceptions.  First, in the PACKAGES block, the model name must be included as a separate string before each package.  Second, the appropriate model name must be included before package name 1 and package name 2 in the BEGIN PERIOD block.  This allows providers and receivers to be located in both models listed as part of this exchange.
