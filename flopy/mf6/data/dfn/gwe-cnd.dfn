longname deactivate xt3d
description deactivate the xt3d method and use the faster and less accurate approximation.  This option may provide a fast and accurate solution under some circumstances, such as when flow aligns with the model grid, there is no mechanical dispersion, or when the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are equal.  This option may also be used to assess the computational demand of the XT3D approach by noting the run time differences with and without this option on.

longname xt3d on right-hand side
description add xt3d terms to right-hand side, when possible.  This option uses less memory, but may require more iterations.

longname longitudinal dispersivity in horizontal direction
description longitudinal dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If flow is strictly horizontal, then this is the longitudinal dispersivity that will be used.  If flow is not strictly horizontal or strictly vertical, then the longitudinal dispersivity is a function of both ALH and ALV.  If mechanical dispersion is represented (by specifying any dispersivity values) then this array is required.

longname longitudinal dispersivity in vertical direction
description longitudinal dispersivity in vertical direction.  If flow is strictly vertical, then this is the longitudinal dispsersivity value that will be used.  If flow is not strictly horizontal or strictly vertical, then the longitudinal dispersivity is a function of both ALH and ALV.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ALH.

longname transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction
description transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction.  This is the transverse dispersivity value for the second ellipsoid axis.  If flow is strictly horizontal and directed in the x direction (along a row for a regular grid), then this value controls spreading in the y direction.  If mechanical dispersion is represented (by specifying any dispersivity values) then this array is required.

longname transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction
description transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction.  This is the transverse dispersivity value for the third ellipsoid axis.  If flow is strictly horizontal and directed in the x direction (along a row for a regular grid), then this value controls spreading in the z direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ATH1.

longname transverse dispersivity when flow is in vertical direction
description transverse dispersivity when flow is in vertical direction.  If flow is strictly vertical and directed in the z direction, then this value controls spreading in the x and y directions.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ATH2.

longname thermal conductivity of the simulated fluid
description thermal conductivity of the simulated fluid.   Note that the CND Package does not account for the tortuosity of the flow paths when solving for the conductive spread of heat.  If tortuosity plays an important role in the thermal conductivity calculation, its effect should be reflected in the value specified for KTW.
