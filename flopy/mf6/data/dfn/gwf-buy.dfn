description name of the binary output file to write density information.  The density file has the same format as the head file.  Density values will be written to the density file whenever heads are written to the binary head file.  The settings for controlling head output are contained in the Output Control option.

longname modelname
description name of an auxiliary variable in a GWF stress package that will be used for this species to calculate a density value.  If a density value is needed by the Buoyancy Package then it will use the concentration values in this AUXSPECIESNAME column in the density equation of state.  For advanced stress packages (LAK, SFR, MAW, and UZF) that have an associated advanced transport package (LKT, SFT, MWT, and UZT), the FLOW\_PACKAGE\_AUXILIARY\_NAME option in the advanced transport package can be used to transfer simulated concentrations into the flow package auxiliary variable.  In this manner, the Buoyancy Package can calculate density values for lakes, streams, multi-aquifer wells, and unsaturated zone flow cells using simulated concentrations.
