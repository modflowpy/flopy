description character string that defines the conductance equation that is used to calculate the saturated conductance for the multi-aquifer well. Possible multi-aquifer well CONDEQN strings include: SPECIFIED--character keyword to indicate the multi-aquifer well saturated conductance will be specified.  THIEM--character keyword to indicate the multi-aquifer well saturated conductance will be calculated using the Thiem equation, which considers the cell top and bottom, aquifer hydraulic conductivity, and effective cell and well radius.  SKIN--character keyword to indicate that the multi-aquifer well saturated conductance will be calculated using the cell top and bottom, aquifer and screen hydraulic conductivity, and well and skin radius.  CUMULATIVE--character keyword to indicate that the multi-aquifer well saturated conductance will be calculated using a combination of the Thiem and SKIN equations.  MEAN--character keyword to indicate the multi-aquifer well saturated conductance will be calculated using the aquifer and screen top and bottom, aquifer and screen hydraulic conductivity, and well and skin radius. The CUMULATIVE conductance equation is identical to the SKIN LOSSTYPE in the Multi-Node Well (MNW2) package for MODFLOW-2005. The program will terminate with an error condition if CONDEQN is SKIN or CUMULATIVE and the calculated saturated conductance is less than zero; if an error condition occurs, it is suggested that the THEIM or MEAN conductance equations be used for these multi-aquifer wells.

If CONDEQN is SPECIFIED, HK\_SKIN must be greater than or equal to zero.  HK\_SKIN can be any value if CONDEQN is THIEM. Otherwise, HK\_SKIN must be greater than zero.

For extraction wells, the extraction rate will start to decrease once the head in the well lowers to a level equal to the pump elevation plus the scaling length.  If the head in the well drops below the pump elevation, then the extraction rate is calculated to be zero.  For an injection well, the injection rate will begin to decrease once the head in the well rises above the specified pump elevation.
