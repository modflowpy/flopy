description is name of the listing file to create for this GWF model.  If not specified, then the name of the list file will be the basename of the GWF model name file and the '.lst' extension.  For example, if the GWF name file is called ``my.model.nam'' then the list file will be called ``my.model.lst''.

longname keyword to activate Newton-Raphson formulation
description keyword that activates the Newton-Raphson formulation for groundwater flow between connected, convertible groundwater cells and stress packages that support calculation of Newton-Raphson terms for groundwater exchanges. Cells will not dry when this option is used. By default, the Newton-Raphson formulation is not applied.

longname keyword to activate Newton-Raphson UNDER_RELAXATION option
description keyword that indicates whether the groundwater head in a cell will be under-relaxed when water levels fall below the bottom of the model below any given cell. By default, Newton-Raphson UNDER\_RELAXATION is not applied.

longname user name for package
description is the user-defined name for the package. PNAME is restricted to 16 characters.  No spaces are allowed in PNAME.  PNAME character values are read and stored by the program for stress packages only.  These names may be useful for labeling purposes when multiple stress packages of the same type are located within a single GWF Model.  If PNAME is specified for a stress package, then PNAME will be used in the flow budget table in the listing file; it will also be used for the text entry in the cell-by-cell budget file.  PNAME is case insensitive and is stored in all upper case letters.
