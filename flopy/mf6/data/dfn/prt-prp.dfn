optional true
longname whether to use local z coordinates
description indicates that ``zrpt'' defines the local z coordinate of the release point within the cell, with value of 0 at the bottom and 1 at the top of the cell.  If the cell is partially saturated at release time, the top of the cell is considered to be the water table elevation (the head in the cell) rather than the top defined by the user.

optional true
longname whether to extend tracking beyond the end of the simulation
description indicates that particles should be tracked beyond the end of the simulation's final time step (using that time step's flows) until particles terminate or reach a specified stop time.  By default, particles are terminated at the end of the simulation's final time step.

block options
name stoptime
type double precision
reader urword
optional true
longname stop time
description real value defining the maximum simulation time to which particles in the package can be tracked.  Particles that have not terminated earlier due to another termination condition will terminate when simulation time STOPTIME is reached.  If the last stress period in the simulation consists of more than one time step, particles will not be tracked past the ending time of the last stress period, regardless of STOPTIME.  If the last stress period in the simulation consists of a single time step, it is assumed to be a steady-state stress period, and its ending time will not limit the simulation time to which particles can be tracked.  If STOPTIME and STOPTRAVELTIME are both provided, particles will be stopped if either is reached.

block options
name stoptraveltime
type double precision
reader urword
optional true
longname stop travel time
description real value defining the maximum travel time over which particles in the model can be tracked.  Particles that have not terminated earlier due to another termination condition will terminate when their travel time reaches STOPTRAVELTIME.  If the last stress period in the simulation consists of more than one time step, particles will not be tracked past the ending time of the last stress period, regardless of STOPTRAVELTIME.  If the last stress period in the simulation consists of a single time step, it is assumed to be a steady-state stress period, and its ending time will not limit the travel time over which particles can be tracked.  If STOPTIME and STOPTRAVELTIME are both provided, particles will be stopped if either is reached.

block options
name stop_at_weak_sink
type keyword
reader urword
optional true
longname stop at weak sink
description is a text keyword to indicate that a particle is to terminate when it enters a cell that is a weak sink.  By default, particles are allowed to pass though cells that are weak sinks.

block options
name istopzone
type integer
reader urword
optional true
longname stop zone number
description integer value defining the stop zone number.  If cells have been assigned IZONE values in the GRIDDATA block, a particle terminates if it enters a cell whose IZONE value matches ISTOPZONE.  An ISTOPZONE value of zero indicates that there is no stop zone.  The default value is zero.

block options
name drape
type keyword
reader urword
optional true
longname drape
description is a text keyword to indicate that if a particle's release point is in a cell that happens to be inactive at release time, the particle is to be moved to the topmost active cell below it, if any. By default, a particle is not released into the simulation if its release point's cell is inactive at release time.

block options
name dry_tracking_method
type string
valid drop stop stay
reader urword
optional true
longname what to do in dry-but-active cells
description is a string indicating how particles should behave in dry-but-active cells (as can occur with the Newton formulation).  The value can be ``DROP'', ``STOP'', or ``STAY''.  The default is ``DROP'', which passes particles vertically and instantaneously to the water table. ``STOP'' causes particles to terminate. ``STAY'' causes particles to remain stationary but active.

block options
name release_time_tolerance
type double precision
reader urword
optional true
longname release time coincidence tolerance
description real number indicating the tolerance within which to consider consecutive release times coincident. Coincident release times will be merged into a single release time. The default is $\epsilon \times 10^{11}$, where $\epsilon$ is machine precision.

block options
name release_time_frequency
type double precision
reader urword
optional true
longname release time frequency
description real number indicating the time frequency at which to release particles. This option can be used to schedule releases at a regular interval for the duration of the simulation, starting at the simulation start time. The release schedule is the union of this option, the RELEASETIMES block, and PERIOD block RELEASESETTING selections. If none of these are provided, a single release time is configured at the beginning of the first time step of the simulation's first stress period.

description is the number of particle release times specified in the RELEASETIMES block. This is not necessarily the total number of release times; release times are the union of RELEASE\_TIME\_FREQUENCY, RELEASETIMES block, and PERIOD block RELEASESETTING selections.

description specifies time steps at which to release a particle. A particle is released at the beginning of each specified time step. For fine control over release timing, specify times explicitly using the RELEASETIMES block. If the beginning of a specified time step coincides with a release time specified in the RELEASETIMES block or configured via RELEASE\_TIME\_FREQUENCY, only one particle is released at that time. Coincidence is evaluated up to the tolerance specified in RELEASE\_TIME\_TOLERANCE, or $\epsilon \times 10^{11}$ by default, where $\epsilon$ is machine precision. If no release times are configured via this setting, the RELEASETIMES block, or the RELEASE\_TIME\_FREQUENCY option, a single release time is configured at the beginning of the first time step of the simulation's first stress period.

description release particles after the specified fraction of the time step has elapsed. If FRACTION is not set, particles are released at the start of the specified time step(s). FRACTION must be a single value when used with ALL, FIRST, or FREQUENCY. When used with STEPS, FRACTION may be a single value or an array of the same length as STEPS. If a single FRACTION value is provided with STEPS, the fraction applies to all steps. NOTE: The FRACTION option has been removed. For fine control over release timing, specify times explicitly using the RELEASETIMES block.
