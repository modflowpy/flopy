optional true
longname time conversion factor
description conversion factor that is used in converting constants used by MODFLOW into model time units.  All constants are by default in units of ``seconds''. TIME\_CONVERSION is used to convert the GRAVITY constant from seconds to the model's units.

optional true
longname do not write binary grid file
description keyword to deactivate writing of the binary grid file.

block options
name xorigin
type double precision
reader urword
optional true
longname x-position origin of the model grid coordinate system
description x-position of the origin used for model grid vertices.  This value should be provided in a real-world coordinate system.  A default value of zero is assigned if not specified.  The value for XORIGIN does not affect the model simulation, but it is written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the grid in space.

block options
name yorigin
type double precision
reader urword
optional true
longname y-position origin of the model grid coordinate system
description y-position of the origin used for model grid vertices.  This value should be provided in a real-world coordinate system.  If not specified, then a default value equal to zero is used.  The value for YORIGIN does not affect the model simulation, but it is written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the grid in space.

block options
name angrot
type double precision
reader urword
optional true
longname rotation angle
description counter-clockwise rotation angle (in degrees) of the model grid coordinate system relative to a real-world coordinate system.  If not specified, then a default value of 0.0 is assigned.  The value for ANGROT does not affect the model simulation, but it is written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the grid in space.

longname number of linear features
description is the number of linear cells.

longname index of the downstream reach
description index of the downstream reach.  Flow from this reach is passed into the dowstream reach.  For reaches that do not flow to another reach enter a 0 to toreach.
numeric_index true

block griddata
name idomain
type integer
shape (nodes)
reader readarray
layered false
optional true
longname idomain existence array
description is an optional array that characterizes the existence status of a cell.  If the IDOMAIN array is not specified, then all model cells exist within the solution.  If the IDOMAIN value for a cell is 0, the cell does not exist in the simulation.  Input and output values will be read and written for the cell, but internal to the program, the cell is excluded from the solution.  If the IDOMAIN value for a cell is 1, the cell exists in the simulation.

reader urword
optional false
longname fractional distance to the cell center
description is the fractional distance to the cell center. FDC is relative to the first vertex in the ICVERT array. In most cases FDC should be 0.5, which would place the center of the line segment that defines the cell. If the value of FDC is 1, the cell center would located at the last vertex. FDC values of 0 and 1 can be used to place the node at either end of the cell which can be useful for cells with boundary conditions.

longname number of cell vertices
description is the number of vertices required to define the cell.  There may be a different number of vertices for each cell.

longname number of cell vertices
description is an array of integer values containing vertex numbers (in the VERTICES block) used to define the cell.  Vertices must be listed in the order that defines the line representing the cell.  Cells that are connected must share vertices. The bottom elevation of the cell is calculated using the ZV of the first and last vertex point and FDC.
