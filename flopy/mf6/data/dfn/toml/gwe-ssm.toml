If the AUX keyword is specified, then the auxiliary variable specified by the user will be assigned as the temperature value for groundwater sources (flows with a positive sign).  For negative flow rates (sinks), groundwater will be withdrawn from the cell at the simulated temperature of the cell.  The AUXMIXED option provides an alternative method for how to determine the temperature of sinks.  If the cell temperature is larger than the user-specified auxiliary temperature, then the temperature of groundwater withdrawn from the cell will be assigned as the user-specified temperature.  Alternatively, if the user-specified auxiliary temperature is larger than the cell temperature, then groundwater will be withdrawn at the cell temperature.  Thus, the AUXMIXED option is designed to work with the Evapotranspiration (EVT) and Recharge (RCH) Packages where water may be withdrawn at a temperature that is less than the cell temperature."
