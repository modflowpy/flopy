If the hydraulic characteristic is negative, then the absolute value of HYDCHR acts as a multiplier to the conductance between the two model cells specified as containing the barrier. For example, if the value for HYDCHR was specified as -1.5, the conductance calculated for the two cells would be multiplied by 1.5."
