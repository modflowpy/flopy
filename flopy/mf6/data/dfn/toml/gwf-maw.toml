RATE_SCALING can be used for extraction or injection wells.  For extraction wells, the extraction rate will start to decrease once the head in the well lowers to a level equal to the pump elevation plus the scaling length.  If the head in the well drops below the pump elevation, then the extraction rate is calculated to be zero.  For an injection well, the injection rate will begin to decrease once the head in the well rises above the specified pump elevation.  If the head in the well rises above the pump elevation plus the scaling length, then the injection rate will be set to zero."
