(2) CPRIOR = `EXCESS', a diversion is made only if $Q_{DS}$ for reach IFNO exceeds the value of DIVFLOW. If this occurs, then the quantity of water diverted is the excess flow ($Q_{DS} -$ DIVFLOW) and $Q_{DS}$ from reach IFNO is set equal to DIVFLOW. This represents a flood-control type of diversion, as described by Danskin and Hanson (2002). (3) CPRIOR = `THRESHOLD', then if $Q_{DS}$ in reach IFNO is less than the specified diversion flow DIVFLOW, no water is diverted from reach IFNO. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach IFNO is greater than or equal to DIVFLOW, DIVFLOW is diverted and $Q_{DS}$ is set to the remainder ($Q_{DS} -$ DIVFLOW)). This approach assumes that once flow in the stream is sufficiently low, diversions from the stream cease, and is the `priority' algorithm that originally was programmed into the STR1 Package (Prudic, 1989).  (4) CPRIOR = `UPTO' -- if $Q_{DS}$ in reach IFNO is greater than or equal to the specified diversion flow DIVFLOW, $Q_{DS}$ is reduced by DIVFLOW. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach IFNO is less than DIVFLOW, DIVFLOW is set to $Q_{DS}$ and there will be no flow available for reaches connected to downstream end of reach IFNO."
