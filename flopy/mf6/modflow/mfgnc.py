    """
    ModflowGnc defines a gnc package.

    Attributes
    ----------
    print_input : (print_input : boolean)
        print_input : keyword to indicate that the list of GNC information will
          be written to the listing file immediately after it is read.
    print_flows : (print_flows : boolean)
        print_flows : keyword to indicate that the list of GNC flow rates will
          be printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in
          which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control. If there is no
          Output Control option and PRINT\_FLOWS is specified, then flow rates
          are printed for the last time step of each stress period.
    explicit : (explicit : boolean)
        explicit : keyword to indicate that the ghost node correction is
          applied in an explicit manner on the right-hand side of the matrix.
          The explicit approach will likely require additional outer
          iterations. If the keyword is not specified, then the correction will
          be applied in an implicit manner on the left-hand side. The implicit
          approach will likely converge better, but may require additional
          memory. If the EXPLICIT keyword is not specified, then the
          BICGSTAB linear acceleration option should be specified within the
          LINEAR block of the Sparse Matrix Solver.
    numgnc : (numgnc : integer)
        numgnc : is the number of GNC entries.
    numalphaj : (numalphaj : integer)
        numalphaj : is the number of contributing factors.
    gncdatarecarray : [(cellidn : (integer, ...)), (cellidm : (integer, ...)),
      (cellidsj : (integer, ...)), (alphasj : double)]
        cellidn : is the cellid of the cell, $n$, in which the ghost node is
          located. For a structured grid that uses the DIS input file,
          cellidn is the layer, row, and column numbers of the cell.
          For a grid that uses the DISV input file, cellidn is the
          layer number and cell2d number for the two cells. If the model uses
          the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then
          cellidn is the node number for the cell.
        cellidm : is the cellid of the connecting cell, $m$, to which flow
          occurs from the ghost node. For a structured grid that uses the DIS
          input file, cellidm is the layer, row, and column numbers of
          the cell. For a grid that uses the DISV input file, cellidm
          is the layer number and cell2d number for the two cells. If the model
          uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file, then
          cellidm is the node number for the cell.
        cellidsj : is the array of cellids for the contributing $j$ cells,
          which contribute to the interpolated head value at the ghost node.
          This item contains one cellid for each of the contributing cells of
          the ghost node. Note that if the number of actual contributing cells
          needed by the user is less than numalphaj for any ghost
          node, then a dummy cellid of zero(s) should be inserted with an
          associated contributing factor of zero. For a structured grid that
          uses the DIS input file, cellid is the layer, row, and
          column numbers of the cell. For a grid that uses the DISV input file,
          cellid is the layer number and cell2d number for the two
          cells. If the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input
          file, then cellid is the node number for the cell.
        alphasj : is the contributing factors for each contributing node in
          cellidsj. Note that if the number of actual contributing
          cells is less than numalphaj for any ghost node, then dummy
          cellids should be inserted with an associated contributing factor of
          zero.
