    Attributes
    ----------
    length_units : (length_units : string)
        length_units : is the length units used for this model. Values can be
          ``FEET'', ``METERS'', or ``CENTIMETERS''. If not specified, the
          default is ``UNKNOWN''.
    nogrb : (nogrb : boolean)
        nogrb : keyword to deactivate writing of the binary grid file.
    xorigin : (xorigin : double)
        xorigin : x-position of the origin used for model grid vertices. This
          value should be provided in a real-world coordinate system. A default
          value of zero is assigned if not specified. The value for
          xorigin does not affect the model simulation, but it is
          written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the
          grid in space.
    yorigin : (yorigin : double)
        yorigin : y-position of the origin used for model grid vertices. This
          value should be provided in a real-world coordinate system. If not
          specified, then a default value equal to zero is used. The value for
          yorigin does not affect the model simulation, but it is
          written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the
          grid in space.
    angrot : (angrot : double)
        angrot : counter-clockwise rotation angle (in degrees) of the model
          grid coordinate system relative to a real-world coordinate system. If
          not specified, then a default value of 0.0 is assigned. The value for
          angrot does not affect the model simulation, but it is
          written to the binary grid file so that postprocessors can locate the
          grid in space.
    nodes : (nodes : integer)
        nodes : is the number of cells in the model grid.
    nja : (nja : integer)
        nja : is the sum of the number of connections and nodes. When
          calculating the total number of connections, the connection between
          cell $n$ and cell $m$ is considered to be different from the
          connection between cell $m$ and cell $n$. Thus, nja is equal
          to the total number of connections, including $n$ to $m$ and $m$ to
          $n$, and the total number of cells.
    nvert : (nvert : integer)
        nvert : is the total number of (x, y) vertex pairs used to define the
          plan-view shape of each cell in the model grid. If nvert is
          not specified or is specified as zero, then the VERTICES and CELL2D
          blocks below are not read.
    top : [(top : double)]
        top : is the top elevation for each cell in the model grid.
    bot : [(bot : double)]
        bot : is the bottom elevation for each cell.
    area : [(area : double)]
        area : is the cell surface area (in plan view).
    iac : [(iac : integer)]
        iac : is the number of connections (plus 1) for each cell. The sum of
          iac must be equal to nja.
    ja : [(ja : integer)]
        ja : is a list of cell number (n) followed by its connecting cell
          numbers (m) for each of the m cells connected to cell n. The number
          of values to provide for cell n is iac(n). This list is
          sequentially provided for the first to the last cell. The first value
          in the list must be cell n itself, and the remaining cells must be
          listed in an increasing order (sorted from lowest number to highest).
          Note that the cell and its connections are only supplied for the GWF
          cells and their connections to the other GWF cells. Also note that
          the JA list input may be chopped up to have every node number and its
          connectivity list on a separate line for ease in readability of the
          file. To further ease readability of the file, the node number of the
          cell whose connectivity is subsequently listed, may be expressed as a
          negative number the sign of which is subsequently corrected by the
          code.
    ihc : [(ihc : integer)]
        ihc : is an index array indicating the direction between node n and all
          of its m connections. If $ihc=0$ -- cell $n$ and cell $m$ are
          connected in the vertical direction. Cell $n$ overlies cell $m$ if
          the cell number for $n$ is less than $m$; cell $m$ overlies cell $n$
          if the cell number for $m$ is less than $n$. If $ihc=1$ -- cell $n$
          and cell $m$ are connected in the horizontal direction. If $ihc=2$ --
          cell $n$ and cell $m$ are connected in the horizontal direction, and
          the connection is vertically staggered. A vertically staggered
          connection is one in which a cell is horizontally connected to more
          than one cell in a horizontal connection.
    cl12 : [(cl12 : double)]
        cl12 : is the array containing connection lengths between the center of
          cell $n$ and the shared face with each adjacent $m$ cell.
    hwva : [(hwva : double)]
        hwva : is a symmetric array of size nja. For horizontal
          connections, entries in hwva are the horizontal width
          perpendicular to flow. For vertical connections, entries in
          hwva are the vertical area for flow. Thus, values in the
          hwva array contain dimensions of both length and area.
          Entries in the hwva array have a one-to-one correspondence
          with the connections specified in the ja array. Likewise,
          there is a one-to-one correspondence between entries in the
          hwva array and entries in the ihc array, which
          specifies the connection type (horizontal or vertical). Entries in
          the hwva array must be symmetric; the program will terminate
          with an error if the value for hwva for an $n-m$ connection
          does not equal the value for hwva for the corresponding
          $m-n$ connection.
    angldegx : [(angldegx : double)]
        angldegx : is the angle (in degrees) between the horizontal x-axis and
          the outward normal to the face between a cell and its connecting
          cells (see figure 8 in the MODFLOW-USG documentation). The angle
          varies between zero and 360.0 degrees. angldegx is only
          needed if horizontal anisotropy is specified in the NPF Package or if
          the XT3D option is used in the NPF Package. angldegx does
          not need to be specified if horizontal anisotropy or the XT3D option
          is not used. angldegx is of size nja; values specified for
          vertical connections and for the diagonal position are not used. Note
          that angldegx is read in degrees, which is different from
          MODFLOW-USG, which reads a similar variable (anglex) in radians.
    verticesrecarray : [(iv : integer), (xv : double), (yv : double)]
        iv : is the vertex number. Records in the VERTICES block must be listed
          in consecutive order from 1 to nvert.
        xv : is the x-coordinate for the vertex.
        yv : is the y-coordinate for the vertex.
    cell2drecarray : [(icell2d : integer), (xc : double), (yc : double), (ncvert :
      integer), (icvert : integer)]
        icell2d : is the cell2d number. Records in the CELL2D block must be
          listed in consecutive order from 1 to nodes.
        xc : is the x-coordinate for the cell center.
        yc : is the y-coordinate for the cell center.
        ncvert : is the number of vertices required to define the cell. There
          may be a different number of vertices for each cell.
        icvert : is an array of integer values containing vertex numbers (in
          the VERTICES block) used to define the cell. Vertices must be listed
          in clockwise order.
