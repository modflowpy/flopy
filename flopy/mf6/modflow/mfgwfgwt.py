    """
    ModflowGwfgwt defines a gwfgwt package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    simulation : MFSimulation
        Simulation that this package is a part of. Package is automatically
        added to simulation when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    exgtype : <string>
        * is the exchange type (GWF-GWF or GWF-GWT).
    exgmnamea : <string>
        * is the name of the first model that is part of this exchange.
    exgmnameb : <string>
        * is the name of the second model that is part of this exchange.
    filename : String
        File name for this package.
    pname : String
        Package name for this package.
    parent_file : MFPackage
        Parent package file that references this package. Only needed for
        utility packages (mfutl*). For example, mfutllaktab package must have
        a mfgwflak package parent_file.
