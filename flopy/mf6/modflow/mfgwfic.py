    Attributes
    ----------
    strt : [(strt : double)]
        strt : is the initial (starting) head---that is, head at the beginning
          of the GWF Model simulation. strt must be specified for all
          simulations, including steady-state simulations. One value is read
          for every model cell. For simulations in which the first stress
          period is steady state, the values used for STRT generally do not
          affect the simulation (exceptions may occur if cells go dry and (or)
          rewet). The execution time, however, will be less if STRT includes
          hydraulic heads that are close to the steady-state solution. A head
          value lower than the cell bottom can be provided if a cell should
          start as dry.
