    """
    ModflowGwflak defines a lak package within a gwf6 model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : MFModel
        Model that this package is a part of.  Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    auxiliary : [string]
        * auxiliary (string) defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable
          names. There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that
          can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided
          in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary
          variable name defined here. The number of auxiliary variables
          detected on this line determines the value for naux. Comments cannot
          be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as
          auxiliary variable names. Auxiliary variables may not be used by the
          package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the
          program. The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary
          variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.

          acceptable. See ts package documentation for more information.
    observations : {varname:data} or continuous data
        * Contains data for the obs package. Data can be stored in a dictionary
          containing data for the obs package with variable names as keys and
          package data as values. Data just for the observations variable is
          also acceptable. See obs package documentation for more information.
    mover : boolean
        * mover (boolean) keyword to indicate that this instance of the LAK
          Package can be used with the Water Mover (MVR) Package. When the
          MOVER option is specified, additional memory is allocated within the
          package to store the available, provided, and received water.

          of feet, meters, or centimeters in the simulation, respectively.
          LENGTH_CONVERSION does not need to be specified if no lake outlets
          are specified or LENGTH_UNITS are meters.
    nlakes : integer
        * nlakes (integer) value specifying the number of lakes that will be
          simulated for all stress periods.
    noutlets : integer
        * noutlets (integer) value specifying the number of outlets that will

          will be used to define the lake stage, volume relation, and surface
          area. If NTABLES is not specified, a default value of zero is used.
    packagedata : [lakeno, strt, nlakeconn, aux, boundname]
        * lakeno (integer) integer value that defines the lake number
          associated with the specified PACKAGEDATA data on the line. LAKENO
          must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NLAKES. Lake
          information must be specified for every lake or the program will
          terminate with an error. The program will also terminate with an
          error if information for a lake is specified more than once. This
          argument is an index variable, which means that it should be treated
          as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will
          automatically subtract one when loading index variables and add one
          when writing index variables.
        * strt (double) real value that defines the starting stage for the
          lake.
        * nlakeconn (integer) integer value that defines the number of GWF
          cells connected to this (LAKENO) lake. There can only be one vertical
          lake connection to each GWF cell. NLAKECONN must be greater than
          zero.
        * aux (double) represents the values of the auxiliary variables for
          each lake. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each
          lake. The values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary
          variables specified in the OPTIONS block. If the package supports
          time series and the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry
          (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from
          a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric
          value.
        * boundname (string) name of the lake cell. BOUNDNAME is an ASCII
          character variable that can contain as many as 40 characters. If
          BOUNDNAME contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be
          enclosed within single quotes.
    connectiondata : [lakeno, iconn, cellid, claktype, bedleak, belev, telev,
      connlen, connwidth]
        * lakeno (integer) integer value that defines the lake number
          associated with the specified CONNECTIONDATA data on the line. LAKENO
          must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NLAKES. Lake
          connection information must be specified for every lake connection to
          the GWF model (NLAKECONN) or the program will terminate with an
          error. The program will also terminate with an error if connection
          information for a lake connection to the GWF model is specified more
          than once. This argument is an index variable, which means that it
          should be treated as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python.
          Flopy will automatically subtract one when loading index variables
          and add one when writing index variables.
        * iconn (integer) integer value that defines the GWF connection number
          for this lake connection entry. ICONN must be greater than zero and
          less than or equal to NLAKECONN for lake LAKENO. This argument is an
          index variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based
          when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract
          one when loading index variables and add one when writing index
          variables.
        * cellid ((integer, ...)) is the cell identifier, and depends on the
          type of grid that is used for the simulation. For a structured grid
          that uses the DIS input file, CELLID is the layer, row, and column.
          For a grid that uses the DISV input file, CELLID is the layer and
          CELL2D number. If the model uses the unstructured discretization
          (DISU) input file, CELLID is the node number for the cell. This
          argument is an index variable, which means that it should be treated
          as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will
          automatically subtract one when loading index variables and add one
          when writing index variables.
        * claktype (string) character string that defines the lake-GWF
          connection type for the lake connection. Possible lake-GWF connection
          type strings include: VERTICAL--character keyword to indicate the
          lake-GWF connection is vertical and connection conductance
          calculations use the hydraulic conductivity corresponding to the
          :math:`K_{33}` tensor component defined for CELLID in the NPF
          package. HORIZONTAL--character keyword to indicate the lake-GWF
          connection is horizontal and connection conductance calculations use
          the hydraulic conductivity corresponding to the :math:`K_{11}` tensor
          component defined for CELLID in the NPF package. EMBEDDEDH--character
          keyword to indicate the lake-GWF connection is embedded in a single
          cell and connection conductance calculations use the hydraulic
          conductivity corresponding to the :math:`K_{11}` tensor component
          defined for CELLID in the NPF package. EMBEDDEDV--character keyword
          to indicate the lake-GWF connection is embedded in a single cell and
          connection conductance calculations use the hydraulic conductivity
          corresponding to the :math:`K_{33}` tensor component defined for
          CELLID in the NPF package. Embedded lakes can only be connected to a
          single cell (NLAKECONN = 1) and there must be a lake table associated
          with each embedded lake.
        * bedleak (double) character string or real value that defines the bed
          leakance for the lake-GWF connection. BEDLEAK must be greater than or
          equal to zero or specified to be NONE. If BEDLEAK is specified to be
          NONE, the lake-GWF connection conductance is solely a function of
          aquifer properties in the connected GWF cell and lakebed sediments
          are assumed to be absent.
        * belev (double) real value that defines the bottom elevation for a
          HORIZONTAL lake-GWF connection. Any value can be specified if
          CLAKTYPE is VERTICAL, EMBEDDEDH, or EMBEDDEDV. If CLAKTYPE is
          HORIZONTAL and BELEV is not equal to TELEV, BELEV must be greater
          than or equal to the bottom of the GWF cell CELLID. If BELEV is equal
          to TELEV, BELEV is reset to the bottom of the GWF cell CELLID.
        * telev (double) real value that defines the top elevation for a
          HORIZONTAL lake-GWF connection. Any value can be specified if
          CLAKTYPE is VERTICAL, EMBEDDEDH, or EMBEDDEDV. If CLAKTYPE is
          HORIZONTAL and TELEV is not equal to BELEV, TELEV must be less than
          or equal to the top of the GWF cell CELLID. If TELEV is equal to
          BELEV, TELEV is reset to the top of the GWF cell CELLID.
        * connlen (double) real value that defines the distance between the
          connected GWF CELLID node and the lake for a HORIZONTAL, EMBEDDEDH,
          or EMBEDDEDV lake-GWF connection. CONLENN must be greater than zero
          for a HORIZONTAL, EMBEDDEDH, or EMBEDDEDV lake-GWF connection. Any
          value can be specified if CLAKTYPE is VERTICAL.
        * connwidth (double) real value that defines the connection face width
          for a HORIZONTAL lake-GWF connection. CONNWIDTH must be greater than
          zero for a HORIZONTAL lake-GWF connection. Any value can be specified
          if CLAKTYPE is VERTICAL, EMBEDDEDH, or EMBEDDEDV.
    tables : [lakeno, tab6_filename]
        * lakeno (integer) integer value that defines the lake number
          associated with the specified TABLES data on the line. LAKENO must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to NLAKES. The program will
          terminate with an error if table information for a lake is specified
          more than once or the number of specified tables is less than
          NTABLES. This argument is an index variable, which means that it
          should be treated as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python.
          Flopy will automatically subtract one when loading index variables
          and add one when writing index variables.
        * tab6_filename (string) character string that defines the path and
          filename for the file containing lake table data for the lake
          connection. The TAB6_FILENAME file includes the number of entries in
          the file and the relation between stage, volume, and surface area for
          each entry in the file. Lake table files for EMBEDDEDH and EMBEDDEDV
          lake-GWF connections also include lake-GWF exchange area data for
          each entry in the file. Instructions for creating the TAB6_FILENAME
          input file are provided in Lake Table Input File section.
    outlets : [outletno, lakein, lakeout, couttype, invert, width, rough,
      slope]
        * outletno (integer) integer value that defines the outlet number
          associated with the specified OUTLETS data on the line. OUTLETNO must
          be greater than zero and less than or equal to NOUTLETS. Outlet
          information must be specified for every outlet or the program will
          terminate with an error. The program will also terminate with an
          error if information for a outlet is specified more than once. This
          argument is an index variable, which means that it should be treated
          as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will
          automatically subtract one when loading index variables and add one
          when writing index variables.
        * lakein (integer) integer value that defines the lake number that
          outlet is connected to. LAKEIN must be greater than zero and less
          than or equal to NLAKES. This argument is an index variable, which
          means that it should be treated as zero-based when working with FloPy
          and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract one when loading index
          variables and add one when writing index variables.
        * lakeout (integer) integer value that defines the lake number that
          outlet discharge from lake outlet OUTLETNO is routed to. LAKEOUT must
          be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to NLAKES. If
          LAKEOUT is zero, outlet discharge from lake outlet OUTLETNO is
          discharged to an external boundary. This argument is an index
          variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based when
          working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract one
          when loading index variables and add one when writing index
          variables.

          outlet is defined using a sharp weir equation.
        * invert (double) real value that defines the invert elevation for the
          lake outlet. Any value can be specified if COUTTYPE is SPECIFIED. If
          the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-
          Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from a time series
          by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        * width (double) real value that defines the width of the lake outlet.
          Any value can be specified if COUTTYPE is SPECIFIED. If the Options

          time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        * rough (double) real value that defines the roughness coefficient for
          the lake outlet. Any value can be specified if COUTTYPE is not
          MANNING. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see
          the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from a

          associated with the specified PERIOD data on the line. NUMBER must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to NLAKES for a lake number
          and less than or equal to NOUTLETS for an outlet number. This
          argument is an index variable, which means that it should be treated
          as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will
          automatically subtract one when loading index variables and add one
          when writing index variables.

                  Input" section), values can be obtained from a time series by
                  entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
            rate : [string]
                * rate (string) real or character value that defines the
                  extraction rate for the lake outflow. A positive value
                  indicates inflow and a negative value indicates outflow from
                  the lake. RATE only applies to active (IBOUND > 0) lakes. A
                  specified RATE is only applied if COUTTYPE for the OUTLETNO
                  is SPECIFIED. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE
                  entry (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be
                  obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name
                  in place of a numeric value. By default, the RATE for each
                  SPECIFIED lake outlet is zero.
            invert : [string]
                * invert (string) real or character value that defines the
                  invert elevation for the lake outlet. A specified INVERT
                  value is only used for active lakes if COUTTYPE for lake
                  outlet OUTLETNO is not SPECIFIED. If the Options block
                  includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-Variable
                  Input" section), values can be obtained from a time series by
                  entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
            width : [string]
                * width (string) real or character value that defines the width
                  of the lake outlet. A specified WIDTH value is only used for
                  active lakes if COUTTYPE for lake outlet OUTLETNO is not
                  SPECIFIED. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE
                  entry (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be
                  obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name
                  in place of a numeric value.
            slope : [string]
                * slope (string) real or character value that defines the bed
                  slope for the lake outlet. A specified SLOPE value is only
                  used for active lakes if COUTTYPE for lake outlet OUTLETNO is
                  MANNING. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry
                  (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be
                  obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name
                  in place of a numeric value.
            rough : [string]
                * rough (string) real value that defines the roughness
                  coefficient for the lake outlet. Any value can be specified
                  if COUTTYPE is not MANNING. If the Options block includes a
                  TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-Variable Input" section),
                  values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
                  time-series name in place of a numeric value.
            auxiliaryrecord : [auxname, auxval]
                * auxname (string) name for the auxiliary variable to be
                  assigned AUXVAL. AUXNAME must match one of the auxiliary
                  variable names defined in the OPTIONS block. If AUXNAME does
                  not match one of the auxiliary variable names defined in the
                  OPTIONS block the data are ignored.
                * auxval (double) value for the auxiliary variable. If the
                  Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-
                  Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from a time
                  series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric
                  value.
    filename : String
        File name for this package.
    pname : String
        Package name for this package.
    parent_file : MFPackage
        Parent package file that references this package. Only needed for
        utility packages (mfutl*). For example, mfutllaktab package must have
        a mfgwflak package parent_file.
