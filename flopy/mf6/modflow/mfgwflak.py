    Attributes
    ----------
    auxiliary : [(auxiliary : string)]
        auxiliary : defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.
          There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be
          provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in
          subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary
          variable name defined here. The number of auxiliary variables
          detected on this line determines the value for naux. Comments cannot
          be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as
          auxiliary variable names. Auxiliary variables may not be used by the
          package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the
          program. The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary
          variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.

          package. See the ``Observation utility'' section for instructions for
          preparing observation input files. Table obstype lists
          observation type(s) supported by the LAK package.
    mover : (mover : boolean)
        mover : keyword to indicate that this instance of the LAK Package can
          be used with the Water Mover (MVR) Package. When the MOVER option is
          specified, additional memory is allocated within the package to store
          the available, provided, and received water.
    surfdep : (surfdep : double)
        surfdep : real value that defines the surface depression depth for
          VERTICAL lake-GWF connections. If specified,

          3.28081, 1.0, and 100.0 when using length units
          (length\_units) of feet, meters, or centimeters in the
          simulation, respectively. length\_conversion does not need

      integer), (aux : double), (boundname : string)]
        lakeno : integer value that defines the lake number associated with the
          specified PACKAGEDATA data on the line. lakeno must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to nlakes. Lake
          information must be specified for every lake or the program will
          terminate with an error. The program will also terminate with an
          error if information for a lake is specified more than once.
        strt : real value that defines the starting stage for the lake.
        nlakeconn : integer value that defines the number of GWF nodes

          series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        boundname : name of the lake cell. boundname is an ASCII character
          variable that can contain as many as 40 characters. If boundname
          contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be enclosed within
          single quotes.

      ...)), (claktype : string), (bedleak : double), (belev : double), (telev
      : double), (connlen : double), (connwidth : double)]
        lakeno : integer value that defines the lake number associated with the
          specified CONNECTIONDATA data on the line. lakeno must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to nlakes. Lake
          connection information must be specified for every lake connection to
          the GWF model (nlakeconn) or the program will terminate with
          an error. The program will also terminate with an error if connection

          than once.
        iconn : integer value that defines the GWF connection number
          for this lake connection entry. iconn must be greater than
          zero and less than or equal to nlakeconn for lake
          lakeno.
        cellid : is the cell identifier, and depends on the type of grid that
          is used for the simulation. For a structured grid that uses the DIS
          input file, cellid is the layer, row, and column. For a grid that
          uses the DISV input file, cellid is the layer and cell2d number. If
          the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file,
          then cellid is the node number for the cell.
        claktype : character string that defines the lake-GWF
          connection type for the lake connection. Possible lake-GWF
          connection type strings include: VERTICAL--character keyword
          to indicate the lake-GWF connection is vertical and
          connection conductance calculations use the hydraulic conductivity
          corresponding to the $K_{33$ tensor component defined for
          cellid in the NPF package. HORIZONTAL--character
          keyword to indicate the lake-GWF connection is horizontal
          and connection conductance calculations use the hydraulic
          conductivity corresponding to the $K_{11$ tensor component defined
          for cellid in the NPF package. EMBEDDEDH--character
          keyword to indicate the lake-GWF connection is embedded in a
          single cell and connection conductance calculations use the hydraulic
          conductivity corresponding to the $K_{11$ tensor component defined
          for cellid in the NPF package. EMBEDDEDV--character
          keyword to indicate the lake-GWF connection is embedded in a
          single cell and connection conductance calculations use the hydraulic
          conductivity corresponding to the $K_{33$ tensor component defined
          for cellid in the NPF package. Embedded lakes can only be
          connected to a single cell (nlakconn = 1) and there must be
          a lake table associated with each embedded lake.
        bedleak : character string or real value that defines the bed leakance
          for the lake-GWF connection. bedleak must be
          greater than or equal to zero or specified to be none. If
          bedleak is specified to be none, the
          lake-GWF connection conductance is solely a function of
          aquifer properties in the connected GWF cell and lakebed
          sediments are assumed to be absent.
        belev : real value that defines the bottom elevation for a
          HORIZONTAL lake-GWF connection. Any value can be
          specified if claktype is VERTICAL,
          EMBEDDEDH, or EMBEDDEDV. If claktype is
          HORIZONTAL and belev is not equal to
          telev, belev must be greater than or equal to the
          bottom of the GWF cell cellid. If belev is
          equal to telev, belev is reset to the bottom of the
          GWF cell cellid.
        telev : real value that defines the top elevation for a
          HORIZONTAL lake-GWF connection. Any value can be
          specified if claktype is VERTICAL,
          EMBEDDEDH, or EMBEDDEDV. If claktype is
          HORIZONTAL and telev is not equal to
          belev, telev must be less than or equal to the top
          of the GWF cell cellid. If telev is equal
          to belev, telev is reset to the top of the
          GWF cell cellid.
        connlen : real value that defines the distance between the connected
          GWF cellid node and the lake for a
          HORIZONTAL, EMBEDDEDH, or EMBEDDEDV
          lake-GWF connection. connlen must be greater than
          zero for a HORIZONTAL, EMBEDDEDH, or
          EMBEDDEDV lake-GWF connection. Any value can be
          specified if claktype is VERTICAL.
        connwidth : real value that defines the connection face width for a
          HORIZONTAL lake-GWF connection. connwidth
          must be greater than zero for a HORIZONTAL lake-GWF
          connection. Any value can be specified if claktype is
          VERTICAL, EMBEDDEDH, or EMBEDDEDV.
    lake_tablesrecarray : [(lakeno : integer), (tab6_filename : string)]
        lakeno : integer value that defines the lake number associated with the
          specified TABLES data on the line. lakeno must be greater
          than zero and less than or equal to nlakes. The program will
          terminate with an error if table information for a lake is specified
          more than once or the number of specified tables is less than
          ntables.
        tab6_filename : character string that defines the path and filename for
          the file containing lake table data for the lake connection. The
          ctabname file includes the number of entries in the file and
          the relation between stage, surface area, and volume for each entry
          in the file. Lake table files for EMBEDDEDH and
          EMBEDDEDV lake-GWF connections also include
          lake-GWF exchange area data for each entry in the file.
          Input instructions for the ctabname file is included at the

          the specified OUTLETS data on the line. outletno must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to noutlets. Outlet
          information must be specified for every outlet or the program will

          error if information for a outlet is specified more than once.
        lakein : integer value that defines the lake number that outlet is
          connected to. lakein must be greater than zero and less than
          or equal to nlakes.

          discharge from lake outlet outletno is routed to.
          lakeout must be greater than or equal to zero and less than
          or equal to nlakes. If lakeout is zero, outlet
          discharge from lake outlet outletno is discharged to an
          external boundary.

          using a sharp weir equation.
        invert : real value that defines the invert elevation for the lake
          outlet. Any value can be specified if couttype is
          SPECIFIED. If the Options block includes a
          TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input''
          section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
          time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        width : real value that defines the width of the lake outlet. Any value
          can be specified if couttype is SPECIFIED. If the
          Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the
          ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time
          series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        rough : real value that defines the roughness coefficient for the lake
          outlet. Any value can be specified if couttype is not
          MANNING. If the Options block includes a

        rate : real or character value that defines the extraction rate for the
          lake outflow. A positive value indicates inflow and a negative value
          indicates outflow from the lake. rate only applies to active
          (IBOUND$>0$) lakes. A specified rate is only
          applied if couttype for the outletno is
