    Attributes
    ----------
    auxiliary : [(auxiliary : string)]
        auxiliary : defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.
          There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be
          provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in
          subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary
          variable name defined here. The number of auxiliary variables
          detected on this line determines the value for naux. Comments cannot
          be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as
          auxiliary variable names. Auxiliary variables may not be used by the
          package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the
          program. The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary
          variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.
    boundnames : (boundnames : boolean)
        boundnames : keyword to indicate that boundary names may be provided
          with the list of multi-aquifer well cells.
    print_input : (print_input : boolean)
        print_input : keyword to indicate that the list of multi-aquifer well
          information will be written to the listing file immediately after it
          is read.
    print_head : (print_head : boolean)
        print_head : keyword to indicate that the list of multi-aquifer well
          heads will be printed to the listing file for every stress period in
          which ``HEAD PRINT'' is specified in Output Control. If there is no
          Output Control option and PRINT\_HEAD is specified, then heads are
          printed for the last time step of each stress period.
    print_flows : (print_flows : boolean)
        print_flows : keyword to indicate that the list of multi-aquifer well
          flow rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress
          period time step in which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output
          Control. If there is no Output Control option and PRINT\_FLOWS is
          specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each
          stress period.
    save_flows : (save_flows : boolean)
        save_flows : keyword to indicate that multi-aquifer well flow terms
          will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in
          Output Control.
    stage_filerecord : [(headfile : string)]
        headfile : name of the binary output file to write stage information.
    budget_filerecord : [(budgetfile : string)]
        budgetfile : name of the binary output file to write budget
          information.
    no_well_storage : (no_well_storage : boolean)
        no_well_storage : keyword that deactivates inclusion of well storage
          contributions to the multi-aquifer well package continuity equation.
    flowing_wells : (flowing_wells : boolean)
        flowing_wells : keyword that activates the flowing wells option for the
          multi-aquifer well package.
    shutdown_theta : (shutdown_theta : double)
        shutdown_theta : value that defines the weight applied to discharge
          rate for wells that limit the water level in a discharging well
          (defined using the HEAD\_LIMIT keyword in the stress period
          data). SHUTDOWN\_THETA is used to control discharge rate
          oscillations when the flow rate from the aquifer is less than the
          specified flow rate from the aquifer to the well. Values range
          between 0.0 and 1.0, and larger values increase the weight (decrease
          under-relaxation) applied to the well discharge rate. The
          head\_limit option has been included to facilitate backward
          compatibility with previous versions of MODFLOW but use of the
          rate\_scaling option instead of the head\_limit
          option is recommended. By default, SHUTDOWN\_THETA is 0.7.
    shutdown_kappa : (shutdown_kappa : double)
        shutdown_kappa : value that defines the weight applied to discharge
          rate for wells that limit the water level in a discharging well
          (defined using the HEAD\_LIMIT keyword in the stress period
          data). SHUTDOWN\_KAPPA is used to control discharge rate
          oscillations when the flow rate from the aquifer is less than the
          specified flow rate from the aquifer to the well. Values range
          between 0.0 and 1.0, and larger values increase the weight applied to
          the well discharge rate. The head\_limit option has been
          included to facilitate backward compatibility with previous versions
          of MODFLOW but use of the rate\_scaling option instead of
          the head\_limit option is recommended. By default,
          SHUTDOWN\_KAPPA is 0.0001.
    ts_filerecord : [(ts6_filename : string)]
        ts6_filename : defines a time-series file defining time series that can
          be used to assign time-varying values. See the ``Time-Variable
          Input'' section for instructions on using the time-series capability.
    obs_filerecord : [(obs6_filename : string)]
        obs6_filename : name of input file to define observations for the MAW
          package. See the ``Observation utility'' section for instructions for
          preparing observation input files. Table obstype lists
          observation type(s) supported by the MAW package.
    mover : (mover : boolean)
        mover : keyword to indicate that this instance of the MAW Package can
          be used with the Water Mover (MVR) Package. When the MOVER option is
          specified, additional memory is allocated within the package to store
          the available, provided, and received water.
    nmawwells : (nmawwells : integer)
        nmawwells : integer value specifying the number of multi-aquifer wells
          that will be simulated for all stress periods.
    wellrecarray : [(wellno : integer), (radius : double), (bottom : double), (strt
      : double), (condeqn : string), (ngwfnodes : integer), (aux : double),
      (boundname : string)]
        wellno : integer value that defines the well number associated with the
          specified PACKAGEDATA data on the line. wellno must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to nmawwells.
          Multi-aquifer well information must be specified for every multi-
          aquifer well or the program will terminate with an error. The program
          will also terminate with an error if information for a multi-aquifer
          well is specified more than once.
        radius : radius for the multi-aquifer well.
        bottom : bottom elevation of the multi-aquifer well.
        strt : starting head for the multi-aquifer well.
        condeqn : character string that defines the conductance equation that
          is used to calculate the saturated conductance for the multi-aquifer
          well. Possible multi-aquifer well condeqn strings include:
          SPECIFIED--character keyword to indicate the multi-aquifer
          well saturated conductance will be specified.
          THEIM--character keyword to indicate the multi-aquifer well
          saturated conductance will be calculated using the Theim equation.
          SKIN--character keyword to indicate that the multi-aquifer
          well saturated conductance will be calculated using the screen top
          and bottom, screen hydraulic conductivity, and skin radius.
          CUMULATIVE--character keyword to indicate that the multi-
          aquifer well saturated conductance will be calculated using a
          combination of the Theim equation and the screen top and bottom,
          screen hydraulic conductivity, and skin radius.
          MEAN--character keyword to indicate the multi-aquifer well
          saturated conductance will be calculated using using the aquifer and
          screen top and bottom, aquifer and screen hydraulic conductivity, and
          well and skin radius.
        ngwfnodes : integer value that defines the number of GWF nodes
          connected to this (wellno) multi-aquifer well. One or more
          screened intervals can be connected to the same GWF node.
          ngwfnodes must be greater than zero.
        aux : represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each multi-
          aquifer well. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for
          each multi-aquifer well. The values must be specified in the order of
          the auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block. If the
          package supports time series and the Options block includes a
          TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section),
          values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series
          name in place of a numeric value.
        boundname : name of the multi-aquifer well cell. boundname is an ASCII
          character variable that can contain as many as 40 characters. If
          boundname contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be
          enclosed within single quotes.
    wellconnectionsrecarray : [(wellno : integer), (icon : integer), (cellid :
      (integer, ...)), (scrn_top : double), (scrn_bot : double), (hk_skin :
      double), (radius_skin : double)]
        wellno : integer value that defines the well number associated with the
          specified CONNECTIONDATA data on the line. wellno must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to nmawwells.
          Multi-aquifer well connection information must be specified for every
          multi-aquifer well connection to the GWF model (ngwfnodes)
          or the program will terminate with an error. The program will also
          terminate with an error if connection information for a multi-aquifer
          well connection to the GWF model is specified more than once.
        icon : integer value that defines the GWF connection number
          for this multi-aquifer well connection entry. iconn must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to ngwfnodes for
          multi-aquifer well wellno.
        cellid : is the cell identifier, and depends on the type of grid that
          is used for the simulation. For a structured grid that uses the DIS
          input file, cellid is the layer, row, and column. For a grid that
          uses the DISV input file, cellid is the layer and cell2d number. If
          the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file,
          then cellid is the node number for the cell.
        scrn_top : value that defines the top elevation of the screen for the
          multi-aquifer well connection. scrn\_top can be any value if
          condeqn is SPECIFIED or THEIM. If the
          specified scrn\_top is greater than the top of the
          GWF cell it is set equal to the top of the cell.
        scrn_bot : value that defines the bottom elevation of the screen for
          the multi-aquifer well connection. scrn\_bot can be any
          value if condeqn is SPECIFIED or THEIM. If
          the specified scrn\_bot is less than the bottom of the
          GWF cell it is set equal to the bottom of the cell.
        hk_skin : value that defines the skin (filter pack) hydraulic
          conductivity (if condeqn for the multi-aquifer well is
          SKIN, CUMULATIVE, or MEAN) or conductance
          (if condeqn for the multi-aquifer well is
          SPECIFIED) for each GWF node connected to the
          multi-aquifer well (ngwfnodes). hk\_skin can be any
          value if condeqn is THEIM.
        radius_skin : real value that defines the skin radius (filter pack
          radius) for the multi-aquifer well. radius\_skin can be any
          value if condeqn is SPECIFIED or THEIM.
          Otherwise, radius\_skin must be greater than radius
          for the multi-aquifer well.
    wellperiodrecarray : [(wellno : integer), (mawsetting : keystring)]
        wellno : integer value that defines the well number associated with the
          specified PERIOD data on the line. wellno must be greater
          than zero and less than or equal to nmawwells.
        mawsetting : line of information that is parsed into a keyword and
          values. Keyword values that can be used to start the
          mawsetting string include: STATUS,
          FLOWING\_WELL, RATE, WELL\_HEAD,
          HEAD\_LIMIT, SHUT\_OFF, RATE\_SCALING, and
          AUXILIARY.
    flowing_well : (flowing_well : boolean)
        flowing_well : keyword to indicate the well is a flowing well. The
          flowing\_well option can be used to simulate flowing wells
          when the simulated well head exceeds the specified drainage
          elevation.
    fwelev : (fwelev : double)
        fwelev : elevation used to determine whether or not the well is
          flowing.
    fwcond : (fwcond : double)
        fwcond : conductance used to calculate the discharge of a free flowing
          well. Flow occurs when the head in the well is above the well top
          elevation (fwelev).
    shut_off : (shut_off : boolean)
        shut_off : keyword for activating well shut off capability. Subsequent
          values define the minimum and maximum pumping rate that a well must
          exceed to shutoff or reactivate a well, respectively, during a stress
          period. shut\_off is only applied to discharging wells
          (rate$<0$) and if head\_limit is specified (not set
          to `off'). If head\_limit is specified,
          shut\_off can be deactivated by specifying a minimum value
          equal to zero. The shut\_off option is based on the
          shut\_off functionality available in the
          MNW2~\citep{konikow2009 package for MODFLOW-2005. The
          shut\_off option has been included to facilitate backward
          compatibility with previous versions of MODFLOW but use of the
          rate\_scaling option instead of the shut\_off
          option is recommended. By default, shut\_off is not used.
    minrate : (minrate : double)
        minrate : is the minimum rate that a well must exceed to shutoff a well
          during a stress period. The well will shut down during a time step if
          the flow rate to the well from the aquifer is less than
          minrate. If a well is shut down during a time step,
          reactivation of the well cannot occur until the next time step to
          reduce oscillations. minrate must be less than
          maxrate.
    maxrate : (maxrate : double)
        maxrate : is the maximum rate that a well must exceed to reactivate a
          well during a stress period. The well will reactivate during a
          timestep if the well was shutdown during the previous time step and
          the flow rate to the well from the aquifer exceeds maxrate.
          Reactivation of the well cannot occur until the next time step if a
          well is shutdown to reduce oscillations. maxrate must be
          greater than minrate.
    rate_scaling : (rate_scaling : boolean)
        rate_scaling : activate rate scaling. If rate\_scaling is
          specified, both pump\_elevation and scaling\_length
          must be specified. rate\_scaling cannot be used with
          head\_limit.
    pump_elevation : (pump_elevation : double)
        pump_elevation : is the elevation of the multi-aquifer well pump
          (pump\_elevation). pump\_elevation cannot be less
          than the bottom elevation (bottom) of the multi-aquifer
          well. By default, pump\_elevation is set equal to the bottom
          of the largest GWF node number connected to a MAW well.
    scaling_length : (scaling_length : double)
        scaling_length : height above the pump elevation
          (scaling\_length) below which the pumping rate is reduced.
          The default value for scaling\_length is the well radius.
    auxname : (auxname : string)
        auxname : name for the auxiliary variable to be assigned
          auxval. auxname must match one of the auxiliary
          variable names defined in the OPTIONS block. If
          auxname does not match one of the auxiliary variable names
          defined in the OPTIONS block the data are ignored.
    auxval : (auxval : double)
        auxval : value for the auxiliary variable. If the Options block
          includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable
          Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by
          entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
