class ModflowGwfnam(mfpackage.MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGwfnam defines a nam package within a gwf6 model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    list : (list : string)
        list : is name of the listing file to create for this GWF model. If not
          specified, then the name of the list file will be the basename of the
          GWF model name file and the '.lst' extension. For example, if the GWF
          name file is called ``my.model.nam'' then the list file will be
          called ``my.model.lst''.
    print_input : (print_input : boolean)
        print_input : keyword to indicate that the list of all model stress
          package information will be written to the listing file immediately
          after it is read.
    print_flows : (print_flows : boolean)
        print_flows : keyword to indicate that the list of all model package
          flow rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress
          period time step in which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output
          Control. If there is no Output Control option and PRINT\_FLOWS is
          specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each
          stress period.
    save_flows : (save_flows : boolean)
        save_flows : keyword to indicate that all model package flow terms will
          be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output
          Control.
    newtonoptions : [(under_relaxation : string)]
        under_relaxation : keyword that indicates whether the groundwater head
          in a cell will be under-relaxed when water levels fall below the
          bottom of the model below any given cell. By default, Newton-Raphson
          UNDER\_RELAXATION is not applied.
    packagerecarray : [(ftype : string), (fname : string), (pname : string)]
        ftype : is the file type, which must be one of the following character
          values shown in tableftype. Ftype may be entered in any
          combination of uppercase and lowercase.
        fname : is the name of the file containing the package input. The path
          to the file should be included if the file is not located in the
          folder where the program was run.
        pname : is the user-defined name for the package. Pname is
          restricted to 16 characters. No spaces are allowed in Pname.
          Pname character values are read and stored by the program
          for stress packages only. These names may be useful for labeling
          purposes when multiple stress packages of the same type are located
          within a single GWF Model. If Pname is specified for a
          stress package, then Pname will be used in the flow budget
          table in the listing file; it will also be used for the text entry in
          the cell-by-cell budget file. Pname is case insensitive and
          is stored in all upper case letters.
