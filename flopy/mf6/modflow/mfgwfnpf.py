class ModflowGwfnpf(mfpackage.MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGwfnpf defines a npf package within a gwf6 model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : MFModel
        Model that this package is a part of.  Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    save_flows : boolean
        * save_flows (boolean) keyword to indicate that budget flow terms will
          be written to the file specified with "BUDGET SAVE FILE" in Output
          Control.
    alternative_cell_averaging : string
        * alternative_cell_averaging (string) is a text keyword to indicate
          that an alternative method will be used for calculating the
          conductance for horizontal cell connections. The text value for
          ALTERNATIVE_CELL_AVERAGING can be "LOGARITHMIC", "AMT-LMK", or "AMT-
          HMK". "AMT-LMK" signifies that the conductance will be calculated
          using arithmetic-mean thickness and logarithmic-mean hydraulic
          conductivity. "AMT-HMK" signifies that the conductance will be
          calculated using arithmetic-mean thickness and harmonic-mean
          hydraulic conductivity. If the user does not specify a value for
          ALTERNATIVE_CELL_AVERAGING, then the harmonic-mean method will be
          used. This option cannot be used if the XT3D option is invoked.
    thickstrt : boolean
        * thickstrt (boolean) indicates that cells having a negative ICELLTYPE
          are confined, and their cell thickness for conductance calculations
          will be computed as STRT-BOT rather than TOP-BOT.
    cvoptions : [dewatered]
        * dewatered (string) If the DEWATERED keyword is specified, then the
          vertical conductance is calculated using only the saturated thickness
          and properties of the overlying cell if the head in the underlying
          cell is below its top.
    perched : boolean
        * perched (boolean) keyword to indicate that when a cell is overlying a
          dewatered convertible cell, the head difference used in Darcy's Law
          is equal to the head in the overlying cell minus the bottom elevation
          of the overlying cell. If not specified, then the default is to use
          the head difference between the two cells.
    rewet_record : [wetfct, iwetit, ihdwet]
        * wetfct (double) is a keyword and factor that is included in the
          calculation of the head that is initially established at a cell when
          that cell is converted from dry to wet.
        * iwetit (integer) is a keyword and iteration interval for attempting
          to wet cells. Wetting is attempted every IWETIT iteration. This
          applies to outer iterations and not inner iterations. If IWETIT is
          specified as zero or less, then the value is changed to 1.
        * ihdwet (integer) is a keyword and integer flag that determines which
          equation is used to define the initial head at cells that become wet.
          If IHDWET is 0, h = BOT + WETFCT (hm - BOT). If IHDWET is not 0, h =
          BOT + WETFCT (THRESH).
    xt3doptions : [rhs]
        * rhs (string) If the RHS keyword is also included, then the XT3D
          additional terms will be added to the right-hand side. If the RHS
          keyword is excluded, then the XT3D terms will be put into the
          coefficient matrix.
    save_specific_discharge : boolean
        * save_specific_discharge (boolean) keyword to indicate that x, y, and
          z components of specific discharge will be calculated at cell centers
          and written to the budget file, which is specified with "BUDGET SAVE
          FILE" in Output Control. If this option is activated, then additional
          information may be required in the discretization packages and the
          GWF Exchange package (if GWF models are coupled). Specifically,
          ANGLDEGX must be specified in the CONNECTIONDATA block of the DISU
          Package; ANGLDEGX must also be specified for the GWF Exchange as an
          auxiliary variable.
    save_saturation : boolean
        * save_saturation (boolean) keyword to indicate that cell saturation
          will be written to the budget file, which is specified with "BUDGET
          SAVE FILE" in Output Control. Saturation will be saved to the budget
          file as an auxiliary variable saved with the DATA-SAT text label.
          Saturation is a cell variable that ranges from zero to one and can be
          used by post processing programs to determine how much of a cell
          volume is saturated. If ICELLTYPE is 0, then saturation is always
          one.
    k22overk : boolean
        * k22overk (boolean) keyword to indicate that specified K22 is a ratio
          of K22 divided by K. If this option is specified, then the K22 array
          entered in the NPF Package will be multiplied by K after being read.
    k33overk : boolean
        * k33overk (boolean) keyword to indicate that specified K33 is a ratio
          of K33 divided by K. If this option is specified, then the K33 array
          entered in the NPF Package will be multiplied by K after being read.
    icelltype : [integer]
        * icelltype (integer) flag for each cell that specifies how saturated
          thickness is treated. 0 means saturated thickness is held constant;
          >0 means saturated thickness varies with computed head when head is
          below the cell top; <0 means saturated thickness varies with computed
          head unless the THICKSTRT option is in effect. When THICKSTRT is in
          effect, a negative value of icelltype indicates that saturated
          thickness will be computed as STRT-BOT and held constant.
    k : [double]
        * k (double) is the hydraulic conductivity. For the common case in
          which the user would like to specify the horizontal hydraulic
          conductivity and the vertical hydraulic conductivity, then K should
          be assigned as the horizontal hydraulic conductivity, K33 should be
          assigned as the vertical hydraulic conductivity, and K22 and the
          three rotation angles should not be specified. When more
          sophisticated anisotropy is required, then K corresponds to the K11
          hydraulic conductivity axis. All included cells (IDOMAIN > 0) must
          have a K value greater than zero.
    k22 : [double]
        * k22 (double) is the hydraulic conductivity of the second ellipsoid
          axis (or the ratio of K22/K if the K22OVERK option is specified); for
          an unrotated case this is the hydraulic conductivity in the y
          direction. If K22 is not included in the GRIDDATA block, then K22 is
          set equal to K. For a regular MODFLOW grid (DIS Package is used) in
          which no rotation angles are specified, K22 is the hydraulic
          conductivity along columns in the y direction. For an unstructured
          DISU grid, the user must assign principal x and y axes and provide
          the angle for each cell face relative to the assigned x direction.
          All included cells (IDOMAIN > 0) must have a K22 value greater than
          zero.
    k33 : [double]
        * k33 (double) is the hydraulic conductivity of the third ellipsoid
          axis (or the ratio of K33/K if the K33OVERK option is specified); for
          an unrotated case, this is the vertical hydraulic conductivity. When
          anisotropy is applied, K33 corresponds to the K33 tensor component.
          All included cells (IDOMAIN > 0) must have a K33 value greater than
          zero.
    angle1 : [double]
        * angle1 (double) is a rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity
          tensor in degrees. The angle represents the first of three sequential
          rotations of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid. With the K11, K22,
          and K33 axes of the ellipsoid initially aligned with the x, y, and z
          coordinate axes, respectively, ANGLE1 rotates the ellipsoid about its
          K33 axis (within the x - y plane). A positive value represents
          counter-clockwise rotation when viewed from any point on the positive
          K33 axis, looking toward the center of the ellipsoid. A value of zero
          indicates that the K11 axis lies within the x - z plane. If ANGLE1 is
          not specified, default values of zero are assigned to ANGLE1, ANGLE2,
          and ANGLE3, in which case the K11, K22, and K33 axes are aligned with
          the x, y, and z axes, respectively.
    angle2 : [double]
        * angle2 (double) is a rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity
          tensor in degrees. The angle represents the second of three
          sequential rotations of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid.
          Following the rotation by ANGLE1 described above, ANGLE2 rotates the
          ellipsoid about its K22 axis (out of the x - y plane). An array can
          be specified for ANGLE2 only if ANGLE1 is also specified. A positive
          value of ANGLE2 represents clockwise rotation when viewed from any
          point on the positive K22 axis, looking toward the center of the
          ellipsoid. A value of zero indicates that the K11 axis lies within
          the x - y plane. If ANGLE2 is not specified, default values of zero
          are assigned to ANGLE2 and ANGLE3; connections that are not user-
          designated as vertical are assumed to be strictly horizontal (that
          is, to have no z component to their orientation); and connection
          lengths are based on horizontal distances.
    angle3 : [double]
        * angle3 (double) is a rotation angle of the hydraulic conductivity
          tensor in degrees. The angle represents the third of three sequential
          rotations of the hydraulic conductivity ellipsoid. Following the
          rotations by ANGLE1 and ANGLE2 described above, ANGLE3 rotates the
          ellipsoid about its K11 axis. An array can be specified for ANGLE3
          only if ANGLE1 and ANGLE2 are also specified. An array must be
          specified for ANGLE3 if ANGLE2 is specified. A positive value of
          ANGLE3 represents clockwise rotation when viewed from any point on
          the positive K11 axis, looking toward the center of the ellipsoid. A
          value of zero indicates that the K22 axis lies within the x - y
          plane.
    wetdry : [double]
        * wetdry (double) is a combination of the wetting threshold and a flag
          to indicate which neighboring cells can cause a cell to become wet.
          If WETDRY < 0, only a cell below a dry cell can cause the cell to
          become wet. If WETDRY > 0, the cell below a dry cell and horizontally
          adjacent cells can cause a cell to become wet. If WETDRY is 0, the
          cell cannot be wetted. The absolute value of WETDRY is the wetting
          threshold. When the sum of BOT and the absolute value of WETDRY at a
          dry cell is equaled or exceeded by the head at an adjacent cell, the
          cell is wetted. WETDRY must be specified if "REWET" is specified in
          the OPTIONS block. If "REWET" is not specified in the options block,
          then WETDRY can be entered, and memory will be allocated for it, even
          though it is not used.
    filename : String
        File name for this package.
    pname : String
        Package name for this package.
    parent_file : MFPackage
        Parent package file that references this package. Only needed for
        utility packages (mfutl*). For example, mfutllaktab package must have
        a mfgwflak package parent_file.
