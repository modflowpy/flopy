class ModflowGwfsfr(mfpackage.MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGwfsfr defines a sfr package within a gwf6 model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : MFModel
        Model that this package is a part of.  Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    auxiliary : [string]
        * auxiliary (string) defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable
          names. There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that
          can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided
          in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary
          variable name defined here. The number of auxiliary variables
          detected on this line determines the value for naux. Comments cannot
          be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as
          auxiliary variable names. Auxiliary variables may not be used by the
          package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the
          program. The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary
          variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.
    boundnames : boolean
        * boundnames (boolean) keyword to indicate that boundary names may be
          provided with the list of stream reach cells.
    print_input : boolean
        * print_input (boolean) keyword to indicate that the list of stream
          reach information will be written to the listing file immediately
          after it is read.
    print_stage : boolean
        * print_stage (boolean) keyword to indicate that the list of stream
          reach stages will be printed to the listing file for every stress
          period in which "HEAD PRINT" is specified in Output Control. If there
          is no Output Control option and PRINT_STAGE is specified, then stages
          are printed for the last time step of each stress period.
    print_flows : boolean
        * print_flows (boolean) keyword to indicate that the list of stream
          reach flow rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress
          period time step in which "BUDGET PRINT" is specified in Output
          Control. If there is no Output Control option and "PRINT_FLOWS" is
          specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each
          stress period.
    save_flows : boolean
        * save_flows (boolean) keyword to indicate that stream reach flow terms
          will be written to the file specified with "BUDGET FILEOUT" in Output
          Control.
    stage_filerecord : [stagefile]
        * stagefile (string) name of the binary output file to write stage
          information.
    budget_filerecord : [budgetfile]
        * budgetfile (string) name of the binary output file to write budget
          information.
    package_convergence_filerecord : [package_convergence_filename]
        * package_convergence_filename (string) name of the comma spaced values
          output file to write package convergence information.
    timeseries : {varname:data} or timeseries data
        * Contains data for the ts package. Data can be stored in a dictionary
          containing data for the ts package with variable names as keys and
          package data as values. Data just for the timeseries variable is also
          acceptable. See ts package documentation for more information.
    observations : {varname:data} or continuous data
        * Contains data for the obs package. Data can be stored in a dictionary
          containing data for the obs package with variable names as keys and
          package data as values. Data just for the observations variable is
          also acceptable. See obs package documentation for more information.
    mover : boolean
        * mover (boolean) keyword to indicate that this instance of the SFR
          Package can be used with the Water Mover (MVR) Package. When the
          MOVER option is specified, additional memory is allocated within the
          package to store the available, provided, and received water.
    maximum_picard_iterations : integer
        * maximum_picard_iterations (integer) value that defines the maximum
          number of Streamflow Routing picard iterations allowed when solving
          for reach stages and flows as part of the GWF formulate step. Picard
          iterations are used to minimize differences in SFR package results
          between subsequent GWF picard (non-linear) iterations as a result of
          non-optimal reach numbering. If reaches are numbered in order, from
          upstream to downstream, MAXIMUM_PICARD_ITERATIONS can be set to 1 to
          reduce model run time. By default, MAXIMUM_PICARD_ITERATIONS is equal
          to 100.
    maximum_iterations : integer
        * maximum_iterations (integer) value that defines the maximum number of
          Streamflow Routing Newton-Raphson iterations allowed for a reach. By
          default, MAXIMUM_ITERATIONS is equal to 100.
    maximum_depth_change : double
        * maximum_depth_change (double) value that defines the depth closure
          tolerance. By default, DMAXCHG is equal to :math:`1 \\times 10^{-5}`.
    unit_conversion : double
        * unit_conversion (double) value (or conversion factor) that is used in
          calculating stream depth for stream reach. A constant of 1.486 is
          used for flow units of cubic feet per second, and a constant of 1.0
          is used for units of cubic meters per second. The constant must be
          multiplied by 86,400 when using time units of days in the simulation.
    nreaches : integer
        * nreaches (integer) integer value specifying the number of stream
          reaches. There must be NREACHES entries in the PACKAGEDATA block.
    packagedata : [rno, cellid, rlen, rwid, rgrd, rtp, rbth, rhk, man, ncon,
      ustrf, ndv, aux, boundname]
        * rno (integer) integer value that defines the reach number associated
          with the specified PACKAGEDATA data on the line. RNO must be greater
          than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. Reach information must
          be specified for every reach or the program will terminate with an
          error. The program will also terminate with an error if information
          for a reach is specified more than once. This argument is an index
          variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based when
          working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract one
          when loading index variables and add one when writing index
          variables.
        * cellid ((integer, ...)) The keyword 'NONE' must be specified for
          reaches that are not connected to an underlying GWF cell. The keyword
          'NONE' is used for reaches that are in cells that have IDOMAIN values
          less than one or are in areas not covered by the GWF model grid.
          Reach-aquifer flow is not calculated if the keyword 'NONE' is
          specified. This argument is an index variable, which means that it
          should be treated as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python.
          Flopy will automatically subtract one when loading index variables
          and add one when writing index variables.
        * rlen (double) real value that defines the reach length. RLEN must be
          greater than zero.
        * rwid (double) real value that defines the reach width. RWID must be
          greater than zero.
        * rgrd (double) real value that defines the stream gradient (slope)
          across the reach. RGRD must be greater than zero.
        * rtp (double) real value that defines the top elevation of the reach
          streambed.
        * rbth (double) real value that defines the thickness of the reach
          streambed. RBTH can be any value if CELLID is 'NONE'. Otherwise, RBTH
          must be greater than zero.
        * rhk (double) real value that defines the hydraulic conductivity of
          the reach streambed. RHK can be any positive value if CELLID is
          'NONE'. Otherwise, RHK must be greater than zero.
        * man (string) real or character value that defines the Manning's
          roughness coefficient for the reach. MAN must be greater than zero.
          If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-
          Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from a time series
          by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        * ncon (integer) integer value that defines the number of reaches
          connected to the reach. If a value of zero is specified for NCON an
          entry for RNO is still required in the subsequent CONNECTIONDATA
          block.
        * ustrf (double) real value that defines the fraction of upstream flow
          from each upstream reach that is applied as upstream inflow to the
          reach. The sum of all USTRF values for all reaches connected to the
          same upstream reach must be equal to one and USTRF must be greater
          than or equal to zero. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE
          entry (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be obtained
          from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a
          numeric value.
        * ndv (integer) integer value that defines the number of downstream
          diversions for the reach.
        * aux (double) represents the values of the auxiliary variables for
          each stream reach. The values of auxiliary variables must be present
          for each stream reach. The values must be specified in the order of
          the auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block. If the
          package supports time series and the Options block includes a
          TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values
          can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name
          in place of a numeric value.
        * boundname (string) name of the stream reach cell. BOUNDNAME is an
          ASCII character variable that can contain as many as 40 characters.
          If BOUNDNAME contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be
          enclosed within single quotes.
    connectiondata : [rno, ic]
        * rno (integer) integer value that defines the reach number associated
          with the specified CONNECTIONDATA data on the line. RNO must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. Reach
          connection information must be specified for every reach or the
          program will terminate with an error. The program will also terminate
          with an error if connection information for a reach is specified more
          than once. This argument is an index variable, which means that it
          should be treated as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python.
          Flopy will automatically subtract one when loading index variables
          and add one when writing index variables.
        * ic (double_precision) integer value that defines the reach number of
          the reach connected to the current reach and whether it is connected
          to the upstream or downstream end of the reach. Negative IC numbers
          indicate connected reaches are connected to the downstream end of the
          current reach. Positive IC numbers indicate connected reaches are
          connected to the upstream end of the current reach. The absolute
          value of IC must be greater than zero and less than or equal to
          NREACHES. IC should not be specified when NCON is zero but must be
          specified otherwise. This argument is an index variable, which means
          that it should be treated as zero-based when working with FloPy and
          Python. Flopy will automatically subtract one when loading index
          variables and add one when writing index variables.
    diversions : [rno, idv, iconr, cprior]
        * rno (integer) integer value that defines the reach number associated
          with the specified DIVERSIONS data on the line. RNO must be greater
          than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. Reach diversion
          information must be specified for every reach with a NDV value
          greater than 0 or the program will terminate with an error. The
          program will also terminate with an error if diversion information
          for a given reach diversion is specified more than once. This
          argument is an index variable, which means that it should be treated
          as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will
          automatically subtract one when loading index variables and add one
          when writing index variables.
        * idv (integer) integer value that defines the downstream diversion
          number for the diversion for reach RNO. IDV must be greater than zero
          and less than or equal to NDV for reach RNO. This argument is an
          index variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based
          when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract
          one when loading index variables and add one when writing index
          variables.
        * iconr (integer) integer value that defines the downstream reach that
          will receive the diverted water. IDV must be greater than zero and
          less than or equal to NREACHES. Furthermore, reach ICONR must be a
          downstream connection for reach RNO. This argument is an index
          variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based when
          working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract one
          when loading index variables and add one when writing index
          variables.
        * cprior (string) character string value that defines the the
          prioritization system for the diversion, such as when insufficient
          water is available to meet all diversion stipulations, and is used in
          conjunction with the value of FLOW value specified in the
          STRESS_PERIOD_DATA section. Available diversion options include: (1)
          CPRIOR = 'FRACTION', then the amount of the diversion is computed as
          a fraction of the streamflow leaving reach RNO (:math:`Q_{DS}`); in
          this case, 0.0 :math:`\\le` DIVFLOW :math:`\\le` 1.0. (2) CPRIOR =
          'EXCESS', a diversion is made only if :math:`Q_{DS}` for reach RNO
          exceeds the value of DIVFLOW. If this occurs, then the quantity of
          water diverted is the excess flow (:math:`Q_{DS} -` DIVFLOW) and
          :math:`Q_{DS}` from reach RNO is set equal to DIVFLOW. This
          represents a flood-control type of diversion, as described by Danskin
          and Hanson (2002). (3) CPRIOR = 'THRESHOLD', then if :math:`Q_{DS}`
          in reach RNO is less than the specified diversion flow DIVFLOW, no
          water is diverted from reach RNO. If :math:`Q_{DS}` in reach RNO is
          greater than or equal to DIVFLOW, DIVFLOW is diverted and
          :math:`Q_{DS}` is set to the remainder (:math:`Q_{DS} -` DIVFLOW)).
          This approach assumes that once flow in the stream is sufficiently
          low, diversions from the stream cease, and is the 'priority'
          algorithm that originally was programmed into the STR1 Package
          (Prudic, 1989). (4) CPRIOR = 'UPTO' -- if :math:`Q_{DS}` in reach RNO
          is greater than or equal to the specified diversion flow DIVFLOW,
          :math:`Q_{DS}` is reduced by DIVFLOW. If :math:`Q_{DS}` in reach RNO
          is less than DIVFLOW, DIVFLOW is set to :math:`Q_{DS}` and there will
          be no flow available for reaches connected to downstream end of reach
          RNO.
    perioddata : [rno, sfrsetting]
        * rno (integer) integer value that defines the reach number associated
          with the specified PERIOD data on the line. RNO must be greater than
          zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. This argument is an index
          variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based when
          working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract one
          when loading index variables and add one when writing index
          variables.
        * sfrsetting (keystring) line of information that is parsed into a
          keyword and values. Keyword values that can be used to start the
          SFRSETTING string include: STATUS, MANNING, STAGE, INFLOW, RAINFALL,
          EVAPORATION, RUNOFF, DIVERSION, UPSTREAM_FRACTION, and AUXILIARY.
            status : [string]
                * status (string) keyword option to define stream reach status.
                  STATUS can be ACTIVE, INACTIVE, or SIMPLE. The SIMPLE STATUS
                  option simulates streamflow using a user-specified stage for
                  a reach or a stage set to the top of the reach (depth = 0).
                  In cases where the simulated leakage calculated using the
                  specified stage exceeds the sum of inflows to the reach, the
                  stage is set to the top of the reach and leakage is set equal
                  to the sum of inflows. Upstream fractions should be changed
                  using the UPSTREAM_FRACTION SFRSETTING if the status for one
                  or more reaches is changed to ACTIVE or INACTIVE. For
                  example, if one of two downstream connections for a reach is
                  inactivated, the upstream fraction for the active and
                  inactive downstream reach should be changed to 1.0 and 0.0,
                  respectively, to ensure that the active reach receives all of
                  the downstream outflow from the upstream reach. By default,
                  STATUS is ACTIVE.
            manning : [string]
                * manning (string) real or character value that defines the
                  Manning's roughness coefficient for the reach. MANNING must
                  be greater than zero. If the Options block includes a
                  TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-Variable Input" section),
                  values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
                  time-series name in place of a numeric value.
            stage : [string]
                * stage (string) real or character value that defines the stage
                  for the reach. The specified STAGE is only applied if the
                  reach uses the simple routing option. If STAGE is not
                  specified for reaches that use the simple routing option, the
                  specified stage is set to the top of the reach. If the
                  Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-
                  Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from a time
                  series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric
                  value.
            inflow : [string]
                * inflow (string) real or character value that defines the
                  volumetric inflow rate for the streamflow routing reach. If
                  the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the
                  "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from a
                  time series by entering the time-series name in place of a
                  numeric value. By default, inflow rates are zero for each
                  reach.
            rainfall : [string]
                * rainfall (string) real or character value that defines the
                  volumetric rate per unit area of water added by precipitation
                  directly on the streamflow routing reach. If the Options
                  block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-Variable
                  Input" section), values can be obtained from a time series by
                  entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By
                  default, rainfall rates are zero for each reach.
            evaporation : [string]
                * evaporation (string) real or character value that defines the
                  volumetric rate per unit area of water subtracted by
                  evaporation from the streamflow routing reach. A positive
                  evaporation rate should be provided. If the Options block
                  includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-Variable
                  Input" section), values can be obtained from a time series by
                  entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. If
                  the volumetric evaporation rate for a reach exceeds the
                  sources of water to the reach (upstream and specified
                  inflows, rainfall, and runoff but excluding groundwater
                  leakage into the reach) the volumetric evaporation rate is
                  limited to the sources of water to the reach. By default,
                  evaporation rates are zero for each reach.
            runoff : [string]
                * runoff (string) real or character value that defines the
                  volumetric rate of diffuse overland runoff that enters the
                  streamflow routing reach. If the Options block includes a
                  TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-Variable Input" section),
                  values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
                  time-series name in place of a numeric value. If the
                  volumetric runoff rate for a reach is negative and exceeds
                  inflows to the reach (upstream and specified inflows, and
                  rainfall but excluding groundwater leakage into the reach)
                  the volumetric runoff rate is limited to inflows to the reach
                  and the volumetric evaporation rate for the reach is set to
                  zero. By default, runoff rates are zero for each reach.
            diversionrecord : [idv, divflow]
                * idv (integer) an integer value specifying which diversion of
                  reach RNO that DIVFLOW is being specified for. Must be less
                  or equal to ndv for the current reach (RNO). This argument is
                  an index variable, which means that it should be treated as
                  zero-based when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will
                  automatically subtract one when loading index variables and
                  add one when writing index variables.
                * divflow (double) real or character value that defines the
                  volumetric diversion (DIVFLOW) rate for the streamflow
                  routing reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE
                  entry (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be
                  obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name
                  in place of a numeric value.
            upstream_fraction : [double]
                * upstream_fraction (double) real value that defines the
                  fraction of upstream flow (USTRF) from each upstream reach
                  that is applied as upstream inflow to the reach. The sum of
                  all USTRF values for all reaches connected to the same
                  upstream reach must be equal to one.
            auxiliaryrecord : [auxname, auxval]
                * auxname (string) name for the auxiliary variable to be
                  assigned AUXVAL. AUXNAME must match one of the auxiliary
                  variable names defined in the OPTIONS block. If AUXNAME does
                  not match one of the auxiliary variable names defined in the
                  OPTIONS block the data are ignored.
                * auxval (double) value for the auxiliary variable. If the
                  Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-
                  Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from a time
                  series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric
                  value.
    filename : String
        File name for this package.
    pname : String
        Package name for this package.
    parent_file : MFPackage
        Parent package file that references this package. Only needed for
        utility packages (mfutl*). For example, mfutllaktab package must have
        a mfgwflak package parent_file.
