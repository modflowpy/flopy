    Attributes
    ----------
    auxiliary : [(auxiliary : string)]
        auxiliary : defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.
          There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be
          provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in
          subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary
          variable name defined here. The number of auxiliary variables
          detected on this line determines the value for naux. Comments cannot
          be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as
          auxiliary variable names. Auxiliary variables may not be used by the
          package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the
          program. The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary
          variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.
    boundnames : (boundnames : boolean)
        boundnames : keyword to indicate that boundary names may be provided
          with the list of stream reach cells.
    print_input : (print_input : boolean)
        print_input : keyword to indicate that the list of stream reach
          information will be written to the listing file immediately after it
          is read.
    print_stage : (print_stage : boolean)
        print_stage : keyword to indicate that the list of stream reach stages
          will be printed to the listing file for every stress period in which
          ``HEAD PRINT'' is specified in Output Control. If there is no Output
          Control option and PRINT\_STAGE is specified, then stages are printed
          for the last time step of each stress period.
    print_flows : (print_flows : boolean)
        print_flows : keyword to indicate that the list of stream reach flow
          rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress period
          time step in which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control.
          If there is no Output Control option and PRINT\_FLOWS is specified,
          then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each stress
          period.
    save_flows : (save_flows : boolean)
        save_flows : keyword to indicate that stream reach flow terms will be
          written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output
          Control.
    stage_filerecord : [(stagefile : string)]
        stagefile : name of the binary output file to write stage information.
    budget_filerecord : [(budgetfile : string)]
        budgetfile : name of the binary output file to write budget
          information.
    ts_filerecord : [(ts6_filename : string)]
        ts6_filename : defines a time-series file defining time series that can
          be used to assign time-varying values. See the ``Time-Variable
          Input'' section for instructions on using the time-series capability.
    obs_filerecord : [(obs6_filename : string)]
        obs6_filename : name of input file to define observations for the SFR
          package. See the ``Observation utility'' section for instructions for
          preparing observation input files. Table obstype lists
          observation type(s) supported by the SFR package.
    mover : (mover : boolean)
        mover : keyword to indicate that this instance of the SFR Package can
          be used with the Water Mover (MVR) Package. When the MOVER option is
          specified, additional memory is allocated within the package to store
          the available, provided, and received water.
    maximum_iterations : (maximum_iterations : double)
        maximum_iterations : value that defines an maximum number of Streamflow
          Routing Newton-Raphson iterations allowed for a reach. By default,
          maxsfrit is equal to 100.
    maximum_depth_change : (maximum_depth_change : double)
        maximum_depth_change : value that defines the depth closure tolerance.

    unit_conversion : (unit_conversion : double)
        unit_conversion : value (or conversion factor) that is used in
          calculating stream depth for stream reach. A constant of 1.486 is
          used for flow units of cubic feet per second, and a constant of 1.0
          is used for units of cubic meters per second. The constant must be
          multiplied by 86,400 when using time units of days in the simulation.
    nreaches : (nreaches : integer)
        nreaches : integer value specifying the number of stream reaches. There
          must be nreaches entries in the PACKAGEDATA block.
    sfrrecarray : [(rno : integer), (cellid : (integer, ...)), (rlen : double),
      (rwid : double), (rgrd : double), (rtp : double), (rbth : double), (rhk :
      double), (man : string), (ncon : integer), (ustrf : double), (ndv :
      integer), (aux : double), (boundname : string)]
        rno : integer value that defines the reach number associated with the
          specified PACKAGEDATA data on the line. rno must be greater
          than zero and less than or equal to nreaches. Reach
          information must be specified for every reach or the program will
          terminate with an error. The program will also terminate with an
          error if information for a reach is specified more than once.
        cellid : The keyword `none' must be specified for reaches that
          are not connected to an underlying GWF cell. The keyword
          `none' is used for reaches that are in cells that have
          IDOMAIN values less than one or are in areas not covered by
          the GWF model grid. Reach-aquifer flow is not calculated if the
          keyword `none' is specified.
        rlen : real value that defines the reach length. rlen must be
          greater than zero.
        rwid : real value that defines the reach width. rwid must be
          greater than zero.
        rgrd : real value that defines the stream gradient (slope) across the
          reach. rgrd must be greater than zero.
        rtp : real value that defines the top elevation of the reach streambed.
        rbth : real value that defines the thickness of the reach streambed.
          rbth can be any value if cellid is `none'.
          Otherwise, rbth must be greater than zero.
        rhk : real value that defines the hydraulic conductivity of the reach
          streambed. rhk can be any positive value if cellid
          is `none'. Otherwise, rhk must be greater than
          zero.
        man : real or character value that defines the Manning's roughness
          coefficient for the reach. man must be greater than zero. If
          the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the
          ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time
          series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        ncon : integer value that defines the number of reaches connected to
          the reach.
        ustrf : real value that defines the fraction of upstream flow from each
          upstream reach that is applied as upstream inflow to the reach. The
          sum of all ustrf values for all reaches connected to the
          same upstream reach must be equal to one and ustrf must be
          greater than or equal to zero.
        ndv : integer value that defines the number of downstream diversions
          for the reach.
        aux : represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each stream
          reach. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each
          stream reach. The values must be specified in the order of the
          auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block. If the package
          supports time series and the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE
          entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be
          obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place
          of a numeric value.
        boundname : name of the stream reach cell. boundname is an ASCII
          character variable that can contain as many as 40 characters. If
          boundname contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be
          enclosed within single quotes.
    reach_connectivityrecarray : [(rno : integer), (ic : integer)]
        rno : integer value that defines the reach number associated with the
          specified CONNECTIONDATA data on the line. rno must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. Reach
          connection information must be specified for every reach or the
          program will terminate with an error. The program will also terminate
          with an error if connection information for a reach is specified more
          than once.
        ic : integer value that defines the reach number of the reach connected
          to the current reach and whether it is connected to the upstream or
          downstream end of the reach. Negative ic numbers indicate
          connected reaches are connected to the downstream end of the current
          reach. Positive ic numbers indicate connected reaches are
          connected to the upstream end of the current reach. The absolute
          value of ic must be greater than zero and less than or equal
          to NREACHES.
    reach_diversionsrecarray : [(rno : integer), (idv : integer), (iconr :
      integer), (cprior : string)]
        rno : integer value that defines the reach number associated with the
          specified DIVERSIONS data on the line. rno must be greater
          than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. Reach
          diversion information must be specified for every reach with a
          ndv value greater than 0 or the program will terminate with
          an error. The program will also terminate with an error if diversion
          information for a given reach diversion is specified more than once.
        idv : integer value that defines the downstream diversion number for
          the diversion for reach rno. idv must be greater
          than zero and less than or equal to ndv for reach
          rno.
        iconr : integer value that defines the downstream reach that will
          receive the diverted water. idv must be greater than zero
          and less than or equal to NREACHES. Furthermore, reach
          iconr must be a downstream connection for reach
          rno.
        cprior : character string value that defines the the prioritization
          system for the diversion, such as when insufficient water is
          available to meet all diversion stipulations, and is used in
          conjunction with the value of flow value specified in the
          STRESS\_PERIOD\_DATA section. Available diversion options
          include: (1) cprior = `FRACTION', then the amount of the
          diversion is computed as a fraction of the streamflow leaving reach
          rno ($Q_{DS$); in this case, 0.0 $\le$ divflow
          $\le$ 1.0. (2) cprior = `EXCESS', a diversion is made only
          if $Q_{DS$ for reach rno exceeds the value of
          divflow. If this occurs, then the quantity of water diverted
          is the excess flow ($Q_{DS -$ divflow) and $Q_{DS$ from
          reach rno is set equal to divflow. This represents
          a flood-control type of diversion, as described by Danskin and Hanson
          (2002). (3) cprior = `THRESHOLD', then if $Q_{DS$ in reach
          rno is less than the specified diversion flow
          (divflow), no water is diverted from reach rno. If
          $Q_{DS$ in reach rno is greater than or equal to
          (divflow), (divflow) is diverted and $Q_{DS$ is
          set to the remainder ($Q_{DS -$ divflow)). This approach
          assumes that once flow in the stream is sufficiently low, diversions
          from the stream cease, and is the `priority' algorithm that
          originally was programmed into the STR1 Package (Prudic, 1989). (4)
          cprior = `UPTO' -- if $Q_{DS$ in reach rno is
          greater than or equal to the specified diversion flow
          (divflow), $Q_{DS$ is reduced by divflow. If
          $Q_{DS$ in reach rno is less than (divflow),
          divflow is set to $Q_{DS$ and there will be no flow
          available for reaches connected to downstream end of reach
          rno.
    reachperiodrecarray : [(rno : integer), (sfrsetting : keystring)]
        rno : integer value that defines the reach number associated with the
          specified PERIOD data on the line. rno must be greater than
          zero and less than or equal to NREACHES.
        sfrsetting : line of information that is parsed into a keyword and
          values. Keyword values that can be used to start the
          sfrsetting string include: STATUS,
          MANNING, STAGE, INFLOW, RAINFALL,
          EVAPORATION, RUNOFF, DIVERSION,
          UPSTREAM\_FRACTION, and AUXILIARY.
    diversion : (diversion : boolean)
        diversion : keyword to indicate diversion record.
    idv : (idv : integer)
        idv : diversion number.
    divrate : (divrate : double)
        divrate : real or character value that defines the volumetric diversion
          (divflow) rate for the streamflow routing reach. If the
          Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-
          Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series
          by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
    auxname : (auxname : string)
        auxname : name for the auxiliary variable to be assigned
          auxval. auxname must match one of the auxiliary
          variable names defined in the OPTIONS block. If
          auxname does not match one of the auxiliary variable names
          defined in the OPTIONS block the data are ignored.
    auxval : (auxval : double)
        auxval : value for the auxiliary variable. If the Options block
          includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input''
          section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
          time-series name in place of a numeric value.
