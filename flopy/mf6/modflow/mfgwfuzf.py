    Attributes
    ----------
    auxiliary : [(auxiliary : string)]
        auxiliary : defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.
          There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be
          provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in
          subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary
          variable name defined here. The number of auxiliary variables
          detected on this line determines the value for naux. Comments cannot
          be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as
          auxiliary variable names. Auxiliary variables may not be used by the
          package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the
          program. The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary
          variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.
    auxmultname : (auxmultname : string)
        auxmultname : name of auxiliary variable to be used as multiplier of
          GWF cell area used by UZF cell.
    boundnames : (boundnames : boolean)
        boundnames : keyword to indicate that boundary names may be provided
          with the list of UZF cells.
    print_input : (print_input : boolean)
        print_input : keyword to indicate that the list of UZF information will
          be written to the listing file immediately after it is read.
    print_flows : (print_flows : boolean)
        print_flows : keyword to indicate that the list of UZF flow rates will
          be printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in
          which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control. If there is no
          Output Control option and PRINT\_FLOWS is specified, then flow rates
          are printed for the last time step of each stress period.
    save_flows : (save_flows : boolean)
        save_flows : keyword to indicate that UZF flow terms will be written to
          the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output Control.
    budget_filerecord : [(budgetfile : string)]
        budgetfile : name of the binary output file to write budget
          information.
    ts_filerecord : [(ts6_filename : string)]
        ts6_filename : defines a time-series file defining time series that can
          be used to assign time-varying values. See the ``Time-Variable
          Input'' section for instructions on using the time-series capability.
    obs_filerecord : [(obs6_filename : string)]
        obs6_filename : name of input file to define observations for the UZF
          package. See the ``Observation utility'' section for instructions for
          preparing observation input files. Table obstype lists
          observation type(s) supported by the UZF package.
    mover : (mover : boolean)
        mover : keyword to indicate that this instance of the UZF Package can
          be used with the Water Mover (MVR) Package. When the MOVER option is
          specified, additional memory is allocated within the package to store
          the available, provided, and received water.
    simulate_et : (simulate_et : boolean)
        simulate_et : keyword specifying that ET in the unsaturated (UZF) and
          saturated zones (GWF) will be simulated. ET can be simulated in the
          UZF cell and not the GWF cell by emitting keywords
          LINEAR\_GWET and SQUARE\_GWET.
    linear_gwet : (linear_gwet : boolean)
        linear_gwet : keyword specifying that groundwater ET will be simulated
          using the original ET formulation of MODFLOW-2005.
    square_gwet : (square_gwet : boolean)
        square_gwet : keyword specifying that groundwater ET will be simulated
          by assuming a constant ET rate for groundwater levels between land
          surface (TOP) and land surface minus the ET extinction depth
          (TOP-EXTDP). Groundwater ET is smoothly reduced from the
          PET rate to zero over a nominal interval at TOP-
          EXTDP.
    simulate_gwseep : (simulate_gwseep : boolean)
        simulate_gwseep : keyword specifying that groundwater discharge
          (GWSEEP) to land surface will be simulated. Groundwater
          discharge is nonzero when groundwater head is greater than land
          surface.
    unsat_etwc : (unsat_etwc : boolean)
        unsat_etwc : keyword specifying that ET in the unsaturated zone will be
          simulated as a function of the specified PET rate while the water
          content (THETA) is greater than the ET extinction water
          content (extwc).
    unsat_etae : (unsat_etae : boolean)
        unsat_etae : keyword specifying that ET in the unsaturated zone will be
          simulated simulated using a capillary pressure based formulation.
          Capillary pressure is calculated using the Brooks-Corey retention
          function.
    nuzfcells : (nuzfcells : integer)
        nuzfcells : is the number of UZF cells. More than 1 UZF cell can be
          assigned to a GWF cell; however, only 1 GWF cell can be assigned to a
          single UZF cell. If the MULTILAYER option is used then UZF cells can
          be assigned to GWF cells below (in deeper layers than) the upper most
          active GWF cells.
    ntrailwaves : (ntrailwaves : integer)
        ntrailwaves : is the number of trailing waves. NTRAILWAVES has a
          default value of 7 and can be increased to lower mass balance error
          in the unsaturated zone.
    nwavesets : (nwavesets : integer)
        nwavesets : is the number of UZF cells specified. NWAVSETS has a
          default value of 40 and can be increased if more waves are required
          to resolve variations in water content within the unsaturated zone.
    uzfrecarray : [(iuzno : integer), (cellid : (integer, ...)), (landflag :
      integer), (ivertcon : integer), (surfdep : double), (vks : double), (thtr
      : double), (thts : double), (thti : double), (eps : double), (boundname :
      string)]
        iuzno : integer value that defines the UZF cell number associated with
          the specified PACKAGEDATA data on the line. iuzno must be
          greater than zero and less than or equal to nuzfcells. UZF
          information must be specified for every UZF cell or the program will
          terminate with an error. The program will also terminate with an
          error if information for a UZF cell is specified more than once.
        cellid : is the cell identifier, and depends on the type of grid that
          is used for the simulation. For a structured grid that uses the DIS
          input file, cellid is the layer, row, and column. For a grid that
          uses the DISV input file, cellid is the layer and cell2d number. If
          the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file,
          then cellid is the node number for the cell.
        landflag : integer value set to one for land surface cells indicating
          that boundary conditions can be applied and data can be specified in
          the PERIOD block. A value of 0 specifies a non-land surface cell.
        ivertcon : integer value set to specify underlying UZF cell that
          receives water flowing to bottom of cell. If unsaturated zone flow
          reaches water table before the cell bottom then water is added to GWF
          cell instead of flowing to underlying UZF cell. A value of 0
          indicates the UZF cell is not connected to an underlying UZF cell.
        surfdep : is the surface depression depth of the UZF cell.
        vks : is the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the UZF cell.
        thtr : is the residual (irreducible) water content of the UZF cell.
        thts : is the saturated water content of the UZF cell.
        thti : is the initial water content of the UZF cell.
        eps : is the epsilon exponent of the UZF cell.
        boundname : name of the UZF cell cell. boundname is an ASCII character
          variable that can contain as many as 40 characters. If boundname
          contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be enclosed within
          single quotes.
    uzfperiodrecarray : [(iuzno : integer), (finf : string), (pet : string), (extdp
      : string), (extwc : string), (ha : string), (hroot : string), (rootact :
      string), (aux : double)]
        iuzno : integer value that defines the UZF cell number associated with
          the specified PERIOD data on the line.
        finf : real or character value that defines the applied infiltration
          rate of the UZF cell ($LT^{-1$). If the Options block includes a
          TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input''
          section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
          time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        pet : real or character value that defines the potential
          evapotranspiration rate of the UZF cell and specified GWF cell.
          Evapotranspiration is first removed from the unsaturated zone and any
          remaining potential evapotranspiration is applied to the saturated
          zone. If ivertcon is greater than zero then residual
          potential evapotranspiration not satisfied in the UZF cell is applied
          to the underlying UZF and GWF cells. pet is always
          specified, but is only used if SIMULATE\_ET is specified in
          the OPTIONS block. If the Options block includes a
          TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input''
          section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
          time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        extdp : real or character value that defines the evapotranspiration
          extinction depth of the UZF cell. If ivertcon is greater
          than zero and extdp extends below the GWF cell bottom then
          remaining potential evapotranspiration is applied to the underlying
          UZF and GWF cells. extdp is always specified, but is only
          used if SIMULATE\_ET is specified in the OPTIONS block. If
          the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the
          ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time
          series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        extwc : real or character value that defines the evapotranspiration
          extinction water content of the UZF cell. extwc is always
          specified, but is only used if SIMULATE\_ET and
          UNSAT\_ETWC are specified in the OPTIONS block. If the
          Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the
          ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time
          series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        ha : real or character value that defines the air entry potential
          (head) of the UZF cell. ha is always specified, but is only
          used if SIMULATE\_ET and UNSAT\_ETAE are specified
          in the OPTIONS block. If the Options block includes a
          TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input''
          section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
          time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        hroot : real or character value that defines the root potential (head)
          of the UZF cell. hroot is always specified, but is only used
          if SIMULATE\_ET and UNSAT\_ETAE are specified in
          the OPTIONS block. If the Options block includes a
          TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input''
          section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
          time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        rootact : real or character value that defines the root activity
          function of the UZF cell. rootact is the length of roots in
          a given volume of soil divided by that volume. Values range from 0 to
          about 3 $cm^{-2$, depending on the plant community and its stage of
          development. rootact is always specified, but is only used
          if SIMULATE\_ET and UNSAT\_ETAE are specified in
          the OPTIONS block. If the Options block includes a
          TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input''
          section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the
          time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        aux : represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each UZF.
          The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each UZF. The
          values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary variables
          specified in the OPTIONS block. If the package supports time series
          and the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the
          ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time
          series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
