    Attributes
    ----------
    auxiliary : [(auxiliary : string)]
        auxiliary : defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.
          There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be
          provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in
          subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary
          variable name defined here. The number of auxiliary variables
          detected on this line determines the value for naux. Comments cannot
          be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as
          auxiliary variable names. Auxiliary variables may not be used by the
          package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the
          program. The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary
          variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.
    auxmultname : (auxmultname : string)
        auxmultname : name of auxiliary variable to be used as multiplier of
          well flow rate.
    boundnames : (boundnames : boolean)
        boundnames : keyword to indicate that boundary names may be provided
          with the list of well cells.
    print_input : (print_input : boolean)
        print_input : keyword to indicate that the list of well information
          will be written to the listing file immediately after it is read.
    print_flows : (print_flows : boolean)
        print_flows : keyword to indicate that the list of well flow rates will
          be printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in
          which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control. If there is no
          Output Control option and PRINT\_FLOWS is specified, then flow rates
          are printed for the last time step of each stress period.
    save_flows : (save_flows : boolean)
        save_flows : keyword to indicate that well flow terms will be written
          to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output Control.
    auto_flow_reduce : (auto_flow_reduce : double)
        auto_flow_reduce : keyword and real value that defines the fraction of
          the cell thickness used as an interval for smoothly adjusting
          negative pumping rates to 0 in cells with head values less than or
          equal to the bottom of the cell. Negative pumping rates are adjusted
          to 0 or a smaller negative value when the head in the cell is equal
          to or less than the calculated interval above the cell bottom.
          auto\_flow\_reduce is set to 0.1 if the specified value is
          less than or equal to zero. By default, negative pumping rates are
          not reduced during a simulation.
    ts_filerecord : [(ts6_filename : string)]
        ts6_filename : defines a time-series file defining time series that can
          be used to assign time-varying values. See the ``Time-Variable
          Input'' section for instructions on using the time-series capability.
    obs_filerecord : [(obs6_filename : string)]
        obs6_filename : name of input file to define observations for the Well
          package. See the ``Observation utility'' section for instructions for
          preparing observation input files. Table obstype lists
          observation type(s) supported by the Well package.
    mover : (mover : boolean)
        mover : keyword to indicate that this instance of the Well Package can
          be used with the Water Mover (MVR) Package. When the MOVER option is
          specified, additional memory is allocated within the package to store
          the available, provided, and received water.
    maxbound : (maxbound : integer)
        maxbound : integer value specifying the maximum number of wells cells
          that will be specified for use during any stress period.
    periodrecarray : [(cellid : (integer, ...)), (q : double), (aux : double),
      (boundname : string)]
        cellid : is the cell identifier, and depends on the type of grid that
          is used for the simulation. For a structured grid that uses the DIS
          input file, cellid is the layer, row, and column. For a grid that
          uses the DISV input file, cellid is the layer and cell2d number. If
          the model uses the unstructured discretization (DISU) input file,
          then cellid is the node number for the cell.
        q : is the volumetric well rate. A positive value indicates recharge
          (injection) and a negative value indicates discharge (extraction). If
          the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-
          Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series
          by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        aux : represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each well.
          The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each well. The
          values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary variables
          specified in the OPTIONS block. If the package supports time series
          and the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the
          ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time
          series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
        boundname : name of the well cell. boundname is an ASCII character
          variable that can contain as many as 40 characters. If boundname
          contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be enclosed within
          single quotes.
