class ModflowGwtgwt(MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGwtgwt defines a GWTGWT package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gwfmodelname1 : string
        keyword to specify name of first corresponding gwf model.  in the simulation
        name file, the gwt6-gwt6 entry contains names for gwt models (exgmnamea and
        exgmnameb).  the gwt model with the name exgmnamea must correspond to the gwf
        model with the name gwfmodelname1.
    gwfmodelname2 : string
        keyword to specify name of second corresponding gwf model.  in the simulation
        name file, the gwt6-gwt6 entry contains names for gwt models (exgmnamea and
        exgmnameb).  the gwt model with the name exgmnameb must correspond to the gwf
        model with the name gwfmodelname2.
    auxiliary : [string]
        an array of auxiliary variable names.  there is no limit on the number of
        auxiliary variables that can be provided. most auxiliary variables will not be
        used by the gwt-gwt exchange, but they will be available for use by other parts
        of the program.  if an auxiliary variable with the name 'angldegx' is found,
        then this information will be used as the angle (provided in degrees) between
        the connection face normal and the x axis, where a value of zero indicates that
        a normal vector points directly along the positive x axis.  the connection face
        normal is a normal vector on the cell face shared between the cell in model 1
        and the cell in model 2 pointing away from the model 1 cell.  additional
        information on 'angldegx' is provided in the description of the disu package.
        angldegx must be specified if dispersion is simulated in the connected gwt
        models.
    boundnames : keyword
        keyword to indicate that boundary names may be provided with the list of gwt
        exchange cells.
    print_input : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of exchange entries will be echoed to the
        listing file immediately after it is read.
    print_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that the list of exchange flow rates will be printed to the
        listing file for every stress period in which 'save budget' is specified in
        output control.
    save_flows : keyword
        keyword to indicate that cell-by-cell flow terms will be written to the budget
        file for each model provided that the output control for the models are set up
        with the 'budget save file' option.
    adv_scheme : string
        scheme used to solve the advection term.  can be upstream, central, or tvd.  if
        not specified, upstream weighting is the default weighting scheme.
    dsp_xt3d_off : keyword
        deactivate the xt3d method for the dispersive flux and use the faster and less
        accurate approximation for this exchange.
    dsp_xt3d_rhs : keyword
        add xt3d dispersion terms to right-hand side, when possible, for this exchange.
    perioddata : record mvt6 filein mvt6_filename
        Contains data for the mvt package. Data can be passed as a dictionary to the
        mvt package with variable names as keys and package data as values. Data for
        the perioddata variable is also acceptable. See mvt package documentation for
        more information.
    observations : record obs6 filein obs6_filename
        Contains data for the obs package. Data can be passed as a dictionary to the
        obs package with variable names as keys and package data as values. Data for
        the observations variable is also acceptable. See obs package documentation for
        more information.
    dev_interfacemodel_on : keyword
        activates the interface model mechanism for calculating the coefficients at
        (and possibly near) the exchange. this keyword should only be used for
        development purposes.
    nexg : integer
        keyword and integer value specifying the number of gwt-gwt exchanges.
    exchangedata : [list]
