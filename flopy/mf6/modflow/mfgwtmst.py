class ModflowGwtmst(mfpackage.MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGwtmst defines a mst package within a gwt6 model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : MFModel
        Model that this package is a part of.  Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    save_flows : boolean
        * save_flows (boolean) keyword to indicate that MST flow terms will be
          written to the file specified with "BUDGET FILEOUT" in Output
          Control.
    first_order_decay : boolean
        * first_order_decay (boolean) is a text keyword to indicate that first-
          order decay will occur. Use of this keyword requires that DECAY and
          DECAY_SORBED (if sorption is active) are specified in the GRIDDATA
          block.
    zero_order_decay : boolean
        * zero_order_decay (boolean) is a text keyword to indicate that zero-
          order decay will occur. Use of this keyword requires that DECAY and
          DECAY_SORBED (if sorption is active) are specified in the GRIDDATA
          block.
    sorption : string
        * sorption (string) is a text keyword to indicate that sorption will be
          activated. Valid sorption options include LINEAR, FREUNDLICH, and
          LANGMUIR. Use of this keyword requires that BULK_DENSITY and DISTCOEF
          are specified in the GRIDDATA block. If sorption is specified as
          FREUNDLICH or LANGMUIR then SP2 is also required in the GRIDDATA
          block.
    porosity : [double]
        * porosity (double) is the aquifer porosity.
    decay : [double]
        * decay (double) is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order decay
          for the aqueous phase of the mobile domain. A negative value
          indicates solute production. The dimensions of decay for first-order
          decay is one over time. The dimensions of decay for zero-order decay
          is mass per length cubed per time. decay will have no effect on
          simulation results unless either first- or zero-order decay is
          specified in the options block.
    decay_sorbed : [double]
        * decay_sorbed (double) is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order
          decay for the sorbed phase of the mobile domain. A negative value
          indicates solute production. The dimensions of decay_sorbed for
          first-order decay is one over time. The dimensions of decay_sorbed
          for zero-order decay is mass of solute per mass of aquifer per time.
          If decay_sorbed is not specified and both decay and sorption are
          active, then the program will terminate with an error. decay_sorbed
          will have no effect on simulation results unless the SORPTION keyword
          and either first- or zero-order decay are specified in the options
          block.
    bulk_density : [double]
        * bulk_density (double) is the bulk density of the aquifer in mass per
          length cubed. bulk_density is not required unless the SORPTION
          keyword is specified.
    distcoef : [double]
        * distcoef (double) is the distribution coefficient for the
          equilibrium-controlled linear sorption isotherm in dimensions of
          length cubed per mass. distcoef is not required unless the SORPTION
          keyword is specified.
    sp2 : [double]
        * sp2 (double) is the exponent for the Freundlich isotherm and the
          sorption capacity for the Langmuir isotherm.
    filename : String
        File name for this package.
    pname : String
        Package name for this package.
    parent_file : MFPackage
        Parent package file that references this package. Only needed for
        utility packages (mfutl*). For example, mfutllaktab package must have
        a mfgwflak package parent_file.
