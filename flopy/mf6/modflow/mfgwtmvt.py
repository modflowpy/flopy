class ModflowGwtmvt(mfpackage.MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGwtmvt defines a mvt package within a gwt6 model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : MFModel
        Model that this package is a part of.  Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    print_input : boolean
        * print_input (boolean) keyword to indicate that the list of mover
          information will be written to the listing file immediately after it
          is read.
    print_flows : boolean
        * print_flows (boolean) keyword to indicate that the list of lake flow
          rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress period
          time step in which "BUDGET PRINT" is specified in Output Control. If
          there is no Output Control option and "PRINT_FLOWS" is specified,
          then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each stress
          period.
    save_flows : boolean
        * save_flows (boolean) keyword to indicate that lake flow terms will be
          written to the file specified with "BUDGET FILEOUT" in Output
          Control.
    budget_filerecord : [budgetfile]
        * budgetfile (string) name of the binary output file to write budget
          information.
    filename : String
        File name for this package.
    pname : String
        Package name for this package.
    parent_file : MFPackage
        Parent package file that references this package. Only needed for
        utility packages (mfutl*). For example, mfutllaktab package must have
        a mfgwflak package parent_file.
