class ModflowGwtsft(mfpackage.MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowGwtsft defines a sft package within a gwt6 model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : MFModel
        Model that this package is a part of.  Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    flow_package_name : string
        * flow_package_name (string) keyword to specify the name of the
          corresponding flow package. If not specified, then the corresponding
          flow package must have the same name as this advanced transport
          package (the name associated with this package in the GWT name file).
    auxiliary : [string]
        * auxiliary (string) defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable
          names. There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that
          can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided
          in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary
          variable name defined here. The number of auxiliary variables
          detected on this line determines the value for naux. Comments cannot
          be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as
          auxiliary variable names. Auxiliary variables may not be used by the
          package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the
          program. The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary
          variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.
    flow_package_auxiliary_name : string
        * flow_package_auxiliary_name (string) keyword to specify the name of
          an auxiliary variable in the corresponding flow package. If
          specified, then the simulated concentrations from this advanced
          transport package will be copied into the auxiliary variable
          specified with this name. Note that the flow package must have an
          auxiliary variable with this name or the program will terminate with
          an error. If the flows for this advanced transport package are read
          from a file, then this option will have no effect.
    boundnames : boolean
        * boundnames (boolean) keyword to indicate that boundary names may be
          provided with the list of reach cells.
    print_input : boolean
        * print_input (boolean) keyword to indicate that the list of reach
          information will be written to the listing file immediately after it
          is read.
    print_concentration : boolean
        * print_concentration (boolean) keyword to indicate that the list of
          reach stages will be printed to the listing file for every stress
          period in which "HEAD PRINT" is specified in Output Control. If there
          is no Output Control option and PRINT_STAGE is specified, then stages
          are printed for the last time step of each stress period.
    print_flows : boolean
        * print_flows (boolean) keyword to indicate that the list of reach flow
          rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress period
          time step in which "BUDGET PRINT" is specified in Output Control. If
          there is no Output Control option and "PRINT_FLOWS" is specified,
          then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each stress
          period.
    save_flows : boolean
        * save_flows (boolean) keyword to indicate that reach flow terms will
          be written to the file specified with "BUDGET FILEOUT" in Output
          Control.
    concentration_filerecord : [concfile]
        * concfile (string) name of the binary output file to write
          concentration information.
    budget_filerecord : [budgetfile]
        * budgetfile (string) name of the binary output file to write budget
          information.
    timeseries : {varname:data} or timeseries data
        * Contains data for the ts package. Data can be stored in a dictionary
          containing data for the ts package with variable names as keys and
          package data as values. Data just for the timeseries variable is also
          acceptable. See ts package documentation for more information.
    observations : {varname:data} or continuous data
        * Contains data for the obs package. Data can be stored in a dictionary
          containing data for the obs package with variable names as keys and
          package data as values. Data just for the observations variable is
          also acceptable. See obs package documentation for more information.
    packagedata : [rno, strt, aux, boundname]
        * rno (integer) integer value that defines the reach number associated
          with the specified PACKAGEDATA data on the line. RNO must be greater
          than zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. Reach information must
          be specified for every reach or the program will terminate with an
          error. The program will also terminate with an error if information
          for a reach is specified more than once. This argument is an index
          variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based when
          working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract one
          when loading index variables and add one when writing index
          variables.
        * strt (double) real value that defines the starting concentration for
          the reach.
        * aux (double) represents the values of the auxiliary variables for
          each reach. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for
          each reach. The values must be specified in the order of the
          auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block. If the package
          supports time series and the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE
          entry (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be obtained
          from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a
          numeric value.
        * boundname (string) name of the reach cell. BOUNDNAME is an ASCII
          character variable that can contain as many as 40 characters. If
          BOUNDNAME contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be
          enclosed within single quotes.
    reachperioddata : [rno, reachsetting]
        * rno (integer) integer value that defines the reach number associated
          with the specified PERIOD data on the line. RNO must be greater than
          zero and less than or equal to NREACHES. This argument is an index
          variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based when
          working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract one
          when loading index variables and add one when writing index
          variables.
        * reachsetting (keystring) line of information that is parsed into a
          keyword and values. Keyword values that can be used to start the
          REACHSETTING string include: STATUS, CONCENTRATION, RAINFALL,
          EVAPORATION, RUNOFF, and AUXILIARY. These settings are used to assign
          the concentration of associated with the corresponding flow terms.
          Concentrations cannot be specified for all flow terms. For example,
          the Streamflow Package supports a "DIVERSION" flow term. Diversion
          water will be routed using the calculated concentration of the reach.
            status : [string]
                * status (string) keyword option to define reach status. STATUS
                  can be ACTIVE, INACTIVE, or CONSTANT. By default, STATUS is
                  ACTIVE, which means that concentration will be calculated for
                  the reach. If a reach is inactive, then there will be no
                  solute mass fluxes into or out of the reach and the inactive
                  value will be written for the reach concentration. If a reach
                  is constant, then the concentration for the reach will be
                  fixed at the user specified value.
            concentration : [string]
                * concentration (string) real or character value that defines
                  the concentration for the reach. The specified CONCENTRATION
                  is only applied if the reach is a constant concentration
                  reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry
                  (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be
                  obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name
                  in place of a numeric value.
            rainfall : [string]
                * rainfall (string) real or character value that defines the
                  rainfall solute concentration :math:`(ML^{-3})` for the
                  reach. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry
                  (see the "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be
                  obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name
                  in place of a numeric value.
            evaporation : [string]
                * evaporation (string) real or character value that defines the
                  concentration of evaporated water :math:`(ML^{-3})` for the
                  reach. If this concentration value is larger than the
                  simulated concentration in the reach, then the evaporated
                  water will be removed at the same concentration as the reach.
                  If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the
                  "Time-Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from a
                  time series by entering the time-series name in place of a
                  numeric value.
            runoff : [string]
                * runoff (string) real or character value that defines the
                  concentration of runoff :math:`(ML^{-3})` for the reach.
                  Value must be greater than or equal to zero. If the Options
                  block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-Variable
                  Input" section), values can be obtained from a time series by
                  entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
            inflow : [string]
                * inflow (string) real or character value that defines the
                  concentration of inflow :math:`(ML^{-3})` for the reach.
                  Value must be greater than or equal to zero. If the Options
                  block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-Variable
                  Input" section), values can be obtained from a time series by
                  entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.
            auxiliaryrecord : [auxname, auxval]
                * auxname (string) name for the auxiliary variable to be
                  assigned AUXVAL. AUXNAME must match one of the auxiliary
                  variable names defined in the OPTIONS block. If AUXNAME does
                  not match one of the auxiliary variable names defined in the
                  OPTIONS block the data are ignored.
                * auxval (double) value for the auxiliary variable. If the
                  Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the "Time-
                  Variable Input" section), values can be obtained from a time
                  series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric
                  value.
    filename : String
        File name for this package.
    pname : String
        Package name for this package.
    parent_file : MFPackage
        Parent package file that references this package. Only needed for
        utility packages (mfutl*). For example, mfutllaktab package must have
        a mfgwflak package parent_file.
