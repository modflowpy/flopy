class ModflowUtlobs(mfpackage.MFPackage):
    """
    ModflowUtlobs defines a obs package within a utl model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : MFModel
        Model that this package is a part of.  Package is automatically
        added to model when it is initialized.
    loading_package : bool
        Do not set this parameter. It is intended for debugging and internal
        processing purposes only.
    digits : integer
        * digits (integer) Keyword and an integer digits specifier used for
          conversion of simulated values to text on output. The default is 5
          digits. When simulated values are written to a file specified as file
          type DATA in the Name File, the digits specifier controls the number
          of significant digits with which simulated values are written to the
          output file. The digits specifier has no effect on the number of
          significant digits with which the simulation time is written for
          continuous observations.
    print_input : boolean
        * print_input (boolean) keyword to indicate that the list of
          observation information will be written to the listing file
          immediately after it is read.
    continuous : [obsname, obstype, id, id2]
        * obsname (string) string of 1 to 40 nonblank characters used to
          identify the observation. The identifier need not be unique; however,
          identification and post-processing of observations in the output
          files are facilitated if each observation is given a unique name.
        * obstype (string) a string of characters used to identify the
          observation type.
        * id (string) Text identifying cell where observation is located. For
          packages other than NPF, if boundary names are defined in the
          corresponding package input file, ID can be a boundary name.
          Otherwise ID is a cellid. If the model discretization is type DIS,
          cellid is three integers (layer, row, column). If the discretization
          is DISV, cellid is two integers (layer, cell number). If the
          discretization is DISU, cellid is one integer (node number). This
          argument is an index variable, which means that it should be treated
          as zero-based when working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will
          automatically subtract one when loading index variables and add one
          when writing index variables.
        * id2 (string) Text identifying cell adjacent to cell identified by ID.
          The form of ID2 is as described for ID. ID2 is used for intercell-
          flow observations of a GWF model, for three observation types of the
          LAK Package, for two observation types of the MAW Package, and one
          observation type of the UZF Package. This argument is an index
          variable, which means that it should be treated as zero-based when
          working with FloPy and Python. Flopy will automatically subtract one
          when loading index variables and add one when writing index
          variables.
    filename : String
        File name for this package.
    pname : String
        Package name for this package.
    parent_file : MFPackage
        Parent package file that references this package. Only needed for
        utility packages (mfutl*). For example, mfutllaktab package must have
        a mfgwflak package parent_file.
