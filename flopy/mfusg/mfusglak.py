class MfUsgLak(Package):
    """
    MODFLOW USG Transport Lake Package Class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : model object
        The model object (of type :class:`flopy.mfusg.MfUsg`) to which
        this package will be added.
    nlakes : int
        NLAKES Number of separate lakes.
        Sublakes of multiple-lake systems are considered separate lakes for
        input purposes. The variable NLAKES is used, with certain internal
        assumptions and approximations, to dimension arrays for the simulation.
    ipakcb : int, optional
        Toggles whether cell-by-cell budget data should be saved. If None or zero,
        budget data will not be saved (default is None).
    lwrt : int or list of ints (one per SP)
        lwrt > 0, suppresses printout from the lake package. Default is 0 (to
        print budget information)
    theta : float
        Explicit (THETA = 0.0), semi-implicit (0.0 < THETA < 1.0), or implicit
        (THETA = 1.0) solution for lake stages. SURFDEPTH is read only if
        THETA is assigned a negative value (the negative value of THETA is
        then changed to a positive value internally by the code).
        *   A new method of solving for lake stage uses only the time-weighting
            factor THETA (Merritt and Konikow, 2000, p. 52) for transient
            simulations. THETA is automatically set to a value of 1.0 for all
            steady-state stress periods. For transient stress periods, Explicit
            (THETA = 0.0), semi-implicit (0.0 < THETA < 1.0), or implicit
            (THETA = 1.0) solutions can be used to calculate lake stages. The
            option to specify negative values for THETA is supported to allow
            specification of additional variables (NSSITER, SSCNCR, SURFDEP)
            for simulations that only include transient stress periods. If
            THETA is specified as a negative value, then it is converted to a
            positive value for calculations of lake stage.
        *   In MODFLOW-2000 and later, ISS is not part of the input. Instead
            NSSITR or SSCNCR should be included if one or more stress periods
            is a steady state stress period as defined in Ss/tr in the
            Discretization file.
        *   SSCNCR and NSSITR can be read for a transient only simulation by
            placing a negative sign immediately in front of THETA. A negative
            THETA sets a flag which assumes input values for NSSITR and SSCNCR
            will follow THETA in the format as described by Merritt and Konikow
            (p. 52). A negative THETA is automatically reset to a positive
            value after values of NSSITR and SSCNCR are read.
    nssitr : int
        Maximum number of iterations for Newton's method of solution for
        equilibrium lake stages in each MODFLOW iteration for steady-state
        aquifer head solution. Only read if ISS (option flag input to DIS
        Package of MODFLOW indicating steady-state solution) is not zero or
        if THETA is specified as a negative value.
        *   NSSITR and SSCNCR may be omitted for transient solutions (ISS = 0).
        *   In MODFLOW-2000 and later, ISS is not part of the input.
            Instead NSSITR or SSCNCR should be included if one or more stress
            periods is a steady state stress period as defined in Ss/tr in the
            Discretization file.
        *   SSCNCR and NSSITR can be read for a transient only simulation by
            placing a negative sign immediately in front of THETA. A negative
            THETA sets a flag which assumes input values for NSSITR and SSCNCR
            will follow THETA in the format as described by Merritt and Konikow
            (p. 52). A negative THETA is automatically reset to a positive
            value after values of NSSITR and SSCNCR are read.
        *   If NSSITR = 0, a value of 100 will be used instead.
    sscncr : float
        Convergence criterion for equilibrium lake stage solution by Newton's
        method. Only read if ISS is not zero or if THETA is specified as a
        negative value. See notes above for nssitr.
    surfdepth : float
        The height of small topological variations (undulations) in lake-bottom
        elevations that can affect groundwater discharge to lakes. SURFDEPTH
        decreases the lakebed conductance for vertical flow across a horizontal
        lakebed caused both by a groundwater head that is between the lakebed
        and the lakebed plus SURFDEPTH and a lake stage that is also between
        the lakebed and the lakebed plus SURFDEPTH. This method provides a
        smooth transition from a condition of no groundwater discharge to a
        lake, when groundwater head is below the lakebed, to a condition of
        increasing groundwater discharge to a lake as groundwater head becomes
        greater than the elevation of the dry lakebed. The method also allows
        for the transition of seepage from a lake to groundwater when the lake
        stage decreases to the lakebed elevation. Values of SURFDEPTH ranging
        from 0.01 to 0.5 have been used successfully in test simulations.
        SURFDEP is read only if THETA is specified as a negative value.
    stages : float or list of floats
        The initial stage of each lake at the beginning of the run.
    stage_range : list of tuples (ssmn, ssmx) of length nlakes
        Where ssmn and ssmx are the minimum and maximum stages allowed for each
        lake in steady-state solution.
        *   SSMN and SSMX are not needed for a transient run and must be
            omitted when the solution is transient.
        *   When the first stress period is a steady-state stress period,
            SSMN is defined in record 3.

        For subsequent steady-state stress periods, SSMN is defined in
        record 9a.
    lakarr : array of integers (nlay, nrow, ncol)
        LKARR A value is read in for every grid cell.
        If LKARR(I,J,K) = 0, the grid cell is not a lake volume cell.
        If LKARR(I,J,K) > 0, its value is the identification number of the lake
        occupying the grid cell. LKARR(I,J,K) must not exceed the value NLAKES.
        If it does, or if LKARR(I,J,K) < 0, LKARR(I,J,K) is set to zero.
        Lake cells cannot be overlain by non-lake cells in a higher layer.
        Lake cells must be inactive cells (IBOUND = 0) and should not be
        convertible to active cells (WETDRY = 0).

        The Lake package can be used when all or some of the model layers
        containing the lake are confined.  The authors recommend using the
        Layer-Property Flow Package (LPF) for this case, although the
        BCF and HUF Packages will work too.  However, when using the BCF6
        package to define aquifer properties, lake/aquifer conductances in the
        lateral direction are based solely on the lakebed leakance (and not on
        the lateral transmissivity of the aquifer layer).  As before, when the
        BCF6 package is used, vertical lake/aquifer conductances are based on
        lakebed conductance and on the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the
        aquifer layer underlying the lake when the wet/dry option is
        implemented, and only on the lakebed leakance when the wet/dry option
        is not implemented.
    bdlknc : array of floats (nlay, nrow, ncol)
        BDLKNC A value is read in for every grid cell. The value is the lakebed
        leakance that will be assigned to lake/aquifer interfaces that occur
        in the corresponding grid cell. If the wet-dry option flag (IWDFLG) is
        not active (cells cannot rewet if they become dry), then the BDLKNC
        values are assumed to represent the combined leakances of the lakebed
        material and the aquifer material between the lake and the centers of
        the underlying grid cells, i. e., the vertical conductance values (CV)
        will not be used in the computation of conductances across lake/aquifer
        boundary faces in the vertical direction.

        IBOUND and WETDRY should be set to zero for every cell for which LKARR
        is not equal to zero. IBOUND is defined in the input to the Basic
        Package of MODFLOW. WETDRY is defined in the input to the BCF or other
        flow package of MODFLOW if the IWDFLG option is active. When used with
        the HUF package, the Lake Package has been modified to compute
        effective lake-aquifer conductance solely on the basis of the
        user-specified value of lakebed leakance; aquifer hydraulic
        conductivities are not used in this calculation. An appropriate
        informational message is now printed after the lakebed conductances
        are written to the main output file.
    sill_data : dict
        (dataset 8 in documentation)
        Dict of lists keyed by stress period. Each list has a tuple of dataset
        8a, 8b for every multi-lake system, where dataset 8a is another tuple of
            IC : int
                The number of sublakes
            ISUB : list of ints
                The identification numbers of the sublakes in the sublake
                system being described in this record. The center lake number
                is listed first.
        And dataset 8b contains
            SILLVT : sequence of floats
                A sequence of sill elevations for each sublakes that determines
                whether the center lake is connected with a given sublake.
                Values are entered for each sublake in the order the sublakes
                are listed in the previous record.
    flux_data : dict
        (dataset 9a in documentation)
        Dict of lists keyed by stress period. The list for each stress period
        is a list of lists, with each list containing the variables
        PRCPLK EVAPLK RNF WTHDRW [SSMN] [SSMX] from the documentation.
            PRCPLK : float
                The rate of precipitation per unit area at the surface of a
                lake (L/T).
            EVAPLK : float
                The rate of evaporation per unit area from the surface of a
                lake (L/T).
            RNF : float
                Overland runoff from an adjacent watershed entering the lake.
                If RNF > 0, it is specified directly as a volumetric rate, or
                flux (L3 /T). If RNF < 0, its absolute value is used as a
                dimensionless multiplier applied to the product of the lake
                precipitation rate per unit area (PRCPLK) and the surface area
                of the lake at its full stage (occupying all layer 1 lake
                cells). When RNF is entered as a dimensionless multiplier
                (RNF < 0), it is considered to be the product of two
                proportionality factors. The first is the ratio of the area of
                the basin contributing runoff to the surface area of the lake
                when it is at full stage. The second is the fraction of the
                current rainfall rate that becomes runoff to the lake. This
                procedure provides a means for the automated computation of
                runoff rate from a watershed to a lake as a function of
                varying rainfall rate. For example, if the basin area is 10
                times greater than the surface area of the lake, and 20 percent
                of the precipitation on the basin becomes overland runoff
                directly into the lake, then set RNF = -2.0.
            WTHDRW : float
                The volumetric rate, or flux (L3 /T), of water removal from a
                lake by means other than rainfall, evaporation, surface
                outflow, or groundwater seepage. A negative value indicates
                augmentation. Normally, this would be used to specify the
                rate of artificial withdrawal from a lake for human water use,
                or if negative, artificial augmentation of a lake volume for
                aesthetic or recreational purposes.
            SSMN : float
                Minimum stage allowed for each lake in steady-state solution.
                See notes on ssmn and ssmx above.
            SSMX : float
                SSMX Maximum stage allowed for each lake in steady-state
                solution.
    conc_data : dict
        (dataset 9b in documentation)
        Dict of lists keyed by stress period. The list for each stress period
        is a list of lists, with each list containing the variables
        CPPT CRNF [CAUG] from the documentation.
            CPPT : float
                concentration of solute in precipitation onto the lake surface
            CRNF : float
                concentration of solute in overland runoff directly into the lake
            CAUG : float
                concentration of solute in water used to augment the lake volume
        if 
    options : list of strings
        Package options. (default is None).
    extension : string
        Filename extension (default is 'lak')
    unitnumber : int
        File unit number (default is None).
    filenames : str or list of str
        Filenames to use for the package and the output files. If
        filenames=None the package name will be created using the model name
        and package extension and the cbc output name will be created using
        the model name and .cbc extension (for example, modflowtest.cbc),
        if ipakcb is a number greater than zero. If a single string is passed
        the package will be set to the string and cbc output names will be
        created using the model name and .cbc extension, if ipakcb is a
        number greater than zero. To define the names for all package files
        (input and output) the length of the list of strings should be 2.
        Default is None.
